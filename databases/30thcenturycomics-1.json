There’s a short cover tear top centre, and the top right edge has been dog-eared and straightened out to some extent. Only very minor residue where free gidft has been removed from the cover and page quality, apart from the stain, is okay.

That’ll be Magno & Davey, Lightning, the Unknown Soldier and Captain Courageous. Four long stories in a packed interior of very accomplished art: Magno & Davey is by L B Cole, Lightning and Lightning Girl by George Gregg, Unknown Soldier by Harvey Kurtzmann and Captain Courageous by L B Cole. The Axis forces didn’t stand a chance! We’ve graded this copy as an Apparent GD, i.e. it has some restoration. Mostly small horizontal tears at the spine have been glued, and the spine has been reinforced and rebuilt at the central staple, which is now firm. There is a 3 cm upper spine split and some flat colour-breaking creases around the cover edges. Nice clean creamy pages and strong colour cover. The price takes the restoration/repair into account.

Its 324 pages contained various Fawcett comics published in their entirity minus covers. It was in fact the first of 7 such seasonal giants published up until 1947. The contents comprise New Captain Marvel Adventures #3, Bulletman #2, Whiz Comics #21, Wow Comics #3 and Master Comics #18, all from 1941, so you get Captain Marvel, Spy Smasher, Mr Scarlet, Minuteman, Bulletman & Bulletgirl and loads of other heroes and villains including Sivana and Hitler. Originally thought to be unsold rebound copies, the current thinking is that they were extra copies from the original print runs set aside specifically for these festive treats. This is a decent copy with strong binding and an intact spine. Surplus glue can be seen along the inside spines front and back, but all of the few copies we have seen online appear to be the same. The cover has bright, vivid colours and the back cover has a great ad for Whiz Comics in full colour featuring Captain Nazi. Page quality is pretty good; one or two taped tears and/or missing corner margins, but nothing horrible. Pictured below.

This is a nice, solid, pence stamped copy with good colour and no cover markings. The staples are tight and firm at spine and centrefold. There is some wear at top edge, with short, spidery colour-breaking creases at bottom edge and spine. Pages are a supple cream colour. We’ve graded it down a little from what it otherwise would be due to tanning at the inside cover edges, with no hint of brittleness. Pictured below.\n\n9 VG p £55 Pence printed, structurally solid with cover unmarked but for slight dust shadow along the right and top edges. Staples are tight and firm at spine and centrefold.

Pence-printed and an Apparent Fair due to the Mr Fantastic pin-up page missing (story complete). The spine and part of the top edge have been taped at some time in their history; tape now removed leaving brown residue. Thumbnail-sized chip out right edge, which is also jagged with Marvel chipping. Lots of cover creases and wear. Bottom staple off at spine, centre okay. Pages are tired with slightly ragged edges in places, not affecting story. Small water stain lower back cover. There is also a vertical tear halfway down the splash page. The missing pin-up page means this is priced as a Poor. Pictured below.\n\n10 VG/FN p £450 The Good Doctor Collection. This above average pence printed copy  is solid and supple with great colour. There are a couple of very soft vertical creases on the cover which do not break colour and a couple of horizontal lines either side of the Human Torch which look like they were there when the copy came off the presses. Tiny nick to right cover edge, but corners only slightly blunted, staples firm at spine and centrefold and nice creamy pages. There is just a suggestion of a narrow dust shadow along the right edge, and printed slightly off centre with the spine line just a couple of mm around the back cover. A very nice example of this early issue.\n\n11 GD/VG p £195 The Bute Collection. 1st Impossible Man & Willie Lumpkin. Not a bad pence-priced copy, with good colour cover; most wear and colour-breaking marks are restricted to the edges or near the spine; there are a few insignificant cover grubby marks and the very slight suggestion of a subscription crease which does not break colour. Staples are firm and reasonably tight. Pages are a nice supple off-white. Pictured below\n\n12 GD- p £400 The Bute Collection. 1st full Marvel Crossover – the FF meet the Hulk. This is a thin, worn pence printed copy; cover colours are okay but a little dulled. There are quite a few creases, particularly near the spine, with some breaking colour, but not generally too heavily. Staples are reasonable, if placed (as printed, we believe) a little in from the true spine. Page quality is cream/light tan, and the pages are tired, with a couple of small tears at page edges without loss. So, not a great copy but complete and not an issue we see turning up very often. Pictured below.\n\n13 VG+ p £350 The Bute Collection. 1st Watcher, 1st Red Ghost & his Super-Apes. A mid-grade pence printed copy. The cover has some reading and handling wear, with a small number of creases, only one or two of which break colour at all, and not in a big way. A couple of small drop stains near the bottom of the logo, but these look like stars or planets in the sky. Staples are tight and firm throughout. Decent colour with creamy, supple pages. Pictured below\n\n18 VG p £185 The Bute Collection. 1st Super-Skrull. This is a decent pence printed copy with good colour, no markings, firm, tight staples and supple off-white pages. Minor edge wear, a little more significant along the top edge where the tiniest corner is nicked at the top right. Inside covers are a little tanned at the edges and there is a faint dust shadow along the right edge of the front cover. Pictured below.\n\n19 GD- p £185 1st Rama-Tut; not a great copy. It is pence stamped, with the original cents price blacked out by an ugly looking stamp (see scan); there are also book shop stamps elsewhere on the cover and the first ‘a’ plus the ‘o’ in the logo have their centres filled in with pen. The top staple is off (at the front only), but the edge wear and corner creasing isn’t too bad, although the comic is a little limp and tired. Page quality is okay.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #19 GD-\n\n20 GD/VG p £160 Solid pence printed copy with reading wear at spine and fine colour-breaking creasing above the logo. Corner blunting, but good off-white pages.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #20 GD/VG\n\n21 App VG p £60 Pence printed; ad/text page out but story complete. Corner blunting, staples a little loose at spine but attached at centre. Very slight chipping to right edge.

Fairly unobtrusive book shop stamps.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #22 VG-\n\n \n23 FA/GD p £70 Pence printed; taped spine hiding lower split and some staining to bottom spine area. A couple of long colour breaking creases diagonally across the logo and story title box, as well as smaller creases breaking colour above that and at bottom right cover. Small cover tears at right and back cover edges. Small chip missing from back cover bottom edge. Staples firm at centrefold; pages are a very reasonable off-white.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #23 FA/GD\n\n24 GD+ p £33\n25 GD/VG p £225 Classic Hulk/Thing fight. A pence printed copy. Rich colour cover with no markings. Staples firm at spine; centrefold loose. Decent pages. Moderate edge and handling wear and corner blunting. Two colour-breaking cover creases, both fairly faint: one across bottom right edge diagonally, one narrow from top to about a third of the way down, culminating in a small edge nick.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #25 GD/VG\n\n27 VG p £150 Sub-Mariner & Dr Strange. Decent pence-printed copy with good cover colour. Edge and spine wear but only minor colour-breaking marks, except for a few short creases across the bottom right corner. Lower staple is coming loose at front cover; upper remains tight and firm. Pages are off-white to cream. Pictured below.\n\n28 VG+ p £180 The Bute Collection. With the X-Men. This solid mid-grade pence printed copy has nothing much in the way of specific defects (a small crease bottom right corner just breaks colour), but just honest wear with a little corner blunting. Staples are tight and firm, spine strong, pages a supple off-white to cream. Pictured below\n\n29 VG p £110 Red Ghost & Super-Apes and Watcher. Pence-printed solid copy.

Pictured below\n\n48 FN/VF p £1,850 The Good Doctor Collection. 1st Silver Surfer, 1st Galactus. Pence printed and in beautiful condition, with vibrant colour cover and a totally unmarked cover scene. Corners are fairly sharp, and staples firmly attached at spine and centrefold. Wear is minimal, mostly restricted to the top edge, but very narrow. There are small handling marks at top corners resulting in tiny creases. Pages are a lovely white to off-white, nearer the white end of that scale. Covers and pages are both beautifully supple and fresh. Just to the right of the Fantastic Four logo there is a soft, barely discernable crease of about 4 cm, with just a hint of a colour break. An iconic Silver Age comic in fabulous condition, which would be a high point of many a collection. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n50 GD/VG £175 The Good Doctor Collection. 3rd part Galactus/Surfer trilogy. This defining issue for the Surfer is a reasonable lower grade cents copy, with a reading crease that breaks colour towards the spine and several spidery creases at the spine itself. There is some edge wear, with a couple of small nicks along the right side. Staples are secure and page quality is a nice off-white. In the lower half of the right cover, between the Surfer’s knee and the Johnny Storm inset panel, there are a number of faint impressions that look like someone was drawing pencil lines on paper and using the comic to rest on, but these are quite difficult to spot. Pictured below.\n\n51 VG/FN £90 Classic ‘This Man…This Monster.’ This is a lovely cents copy with reasonable gloss, and a cover without marks except a slight grubbiness over the number box. Slight corner blunting, and a couple of creases at the right edge, one very short and one longer but very soft, about 8 cm across the Invisible Girl and the Thing, although neither break colour and are difficult to see. Staples are good at spine and centrefold and page quality a supple off-white. Very slight tanning at inside cover edges. Pictured below.\n\n52 GD/VG £300 The Good Doctor Collection. 1st Black Panther. This cents copy has sustained some damage in its life, most notably some creasing in from the right edge over the Panther’s arm and cloak, a little of which breaks colour, and a tear/split of 2.5 cm at the base of the spine, leading to a diagonal crease from the top of the split down across the cover to the bottom right corner. There is also other spine and edge wear, but nothing too bad. A tiny spine split lurks at the top of the back cover, leading to a small, narrow stain of about 4 cm. The inside covers are a little cream/tan, the page quality a supple off-white to cream. Overall, this doesn’t present too badly at all.Pictured below.\n\n54 FN p £27\n57 VF £295 The Bute Collection.

Green Printing Error Variant. Two of the 4 ink colors (magenta, cyan, yellow and black) used to create all the colors on the cover (they are mixed at various percentages) were applied to the wrong plates before printing. It appears that a relatively small number of these ‘green printing variants’ were ciculated before the error was corrected on the majority of the print run. Some copies must even been exported, since our example here bears a pence stamp. Nice copy with good (if odd!) colours and gloss. Firmly attached staples, supple off-white pages. Minor edge wear and very slight corner blunting, with a small dink at the spine bottom where a tiny crease across the very edge just breaks colour. Pictured below.

This is a low grade, pence printed copy. There are plenty of flaws, but none too horrific. There is a softish central crease vertically down the cover, like a subscription crease but not as severe, occasionally breaking colour. Spine splits at top (3.5 cm) and bottom (0.5 cm). Off top staple, bottom okay, although off at centrefold. Small pea-sized hole in front cover in Spidey’s right arm. Chipping towards bottom right edge, with small chips out. Narrow dust shadow along right edge. Moderate tanning around the edges of inside covers. Edge wear isn’t too bad at all, but there are some creases that break colour along the bottom edge. However, the cover colour is good with a strong image; pages are a reasonable cream to light tan. Pictured below; high resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n5 FN+ p £1,450 Vs Dr Doom. This pence printed copy is a beauty, with a clean and colourful vibrant, glossy cover, hardly any corner blunting and an absolute minimum of edge wear. Staples are firmly attached at spine and centrefold. No creasing apart from a small dink at the base of the spine which barely breaks colour and a soft narrow crease on the bottom edge of the back cover only. Pages are supple, flexible and on the white side of off-white. Conservatively graded at FN+. Pictured below; high resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n6 FN/VF p £1,500 1st Lizard; an outstanding copy, pence printed, in a superior grade. Glossy, virtually flat, sharp corners, tight staples and a vivid, unmarked cover scene; the page quality is superb, very close to white pages. There are only the smallest flaws: a small dink at the top corner of the masthead (does not break colour), a very tiny scuff at the base of the Lizard’s lower claw (which you really have to look hard to see) and a couple of very soft, short creases towards the bottom of the spine, which do not break colour and again can barely be seen. We hardly ever see such an early issue of Amazing Spider-Man is such fantastic condition. Pictured below; high resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n6 VG- p £650 1st Lizard. This pence printed copy is clean and unmarked with strong colour and some gloss. The corners are just a little blunted, with a tiny chip out of the top edge at the left corner of the masthead box and an even smaller chip out of the right edge at centre. Just above the latter is a thin tear, barely visible, that extends horizontally from the right edge for less than 2 cm. Leading from this are a couple of short creases that only faintly break colour. The spine has only very minor wear and the remainder of the edges are unworn. Pages are a supple off-white to cream and staples are tight and flat at spine and centrefold. Inside covers are tanned at edges without sign of brittleness, and the grade has been adjusted to reflect this. A very attractive copy that looks better than the grade awarded and presents well. Pictured below. High grade images are available on request.\n\n\n\n7 GD- £245 The Good Doctor Collection. Plenty of flaws: spine roll, a loose centrefold, a small biro figure ‘6’ on the cover by the Vulture’s head, long vertical colour breaking cover crease and lots of similar smaller ones, edge wear and worn spine, ragged right edge pages, back cover tears and a small front cover tear bottom right; the most significant defect is a jagged finger-size section missing from the bottom of the spine (see scan). For all that, it is otherwise complete, the colours are good and the page quality acceptable. Certainly a great gap-filler for the budget conscious. Pictured below\n\n\n9 GD+ p £350 The Good Doctor Collection. 1st Electro. This is a lower graded pence printed copy, with the front cover off the bottom staple; otherwise the staples are firm throughout. Edge and corner wear aren’t heavy, with a few fine creases just breaking colour at bottom right corner. There is a long diagonal crease faintly breaking colour from centre bottom logo down down across the text to level with Electro’s shoulders. The cover colours are a little muted. Pages are a supple, decent off-white to cream. Pictured bekow.\n\n10 VG+ p £315 1st Big Man & the Enforcers. This pence-printed copy is structurally very sound, nice and flat with virtually no creasing except one or two minor spine ticks; there is a tiny chip out centre cover right edge. Staples are tight and firm, pages a supple off-white to cream. Cover colour is strong. Inside covers have some tanning at edges, but are not brittle. The main defect is a narrow dust shadow which runs along the length of the right cover edge (see scan). If you can live with this, you can get a really nice copy of this early issue at a good price. Pictured below.\n\n13 VF- p £2,000 1st Mysterio. The Good Doctor Collection. A supple pence printed copy, with sharp corners, great cover colour and nice gloss, flat with tight firm staples, and an unmarked cover, white to off-white pages. The only wear comprises a few ticks along the spine and a short, non-colour breaking crease of about 2.5 cm at the bottom of the black border to the left of the cover. An absolute gem; pictured below; high grade images are available on request.\n\n\n14 VG/FN p £1,600 1st Green Goblin. This is a solid pence printed copy, with good cover colour, just minor spine and edge wear (with virtually no creasing), staples tight and firm at spine and centrefold and supple pages that are off-white with hints of tan at the edges. There is some corner blunting (but nothing serious) and a not too significant narrow dust shadow down the right edge of the cover. The inside covers are tanning at the edges, but there is no sign of brittleness. Overall a decent copy that presents well. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n15 VG/FN p £700 The Good Doctor Collection. 1st Kraven the Hunter. This is a very decent mid-grade pence printed copy, with residual cover gloss and an unmarked cover image with strong colour. Minor handling wear towards spine with a very faint crease across Spidey’s right foot which only threatens to break colour. Tiny colour-breaking crease across top right corner. Edge and spine wear is minor. Staples are strong and firm at spine and centrefold. Pages are a nice off-white to cream, with some tanning to edges of inside covers; no brittleness. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n17 FN- p £260 The Good Doctor Collection. 2nd Green Goblin. A nice, fresh pence-printed copy, with rich, bright colours, tight, firm staples and supple white to off-white pages. There’s minor wear along the top edge, a soft, faint 4 cm vertical crease down the centre of the logo which barely breaks colour and some tiny creasing in the bottom corner extremities. A couple of spine ticks just break colour. Conservatively graded. Pictured below.\n\n19 GD/VG £110 A decent enough cents copy, a bit worn but with no cover markings. A colour-breaking vertical crease left of centre from logo down across title box, but no colour breaks as far as Spidey’s figure. Minor chipping to top and right edge, corner blunting with tiny tear at top of spine. Staples are tight and firm, pages are off white to cream with small stain to top of margin on just a few pages. A little tired but not bad. Pictured below\n\n20 GD/VG p £285 1st Scorpion. Pence stamped, solid and firm, with nice colour cover and gloss, tight and firmly attached staples. Pages are supple, creamy to slightly tan. Faint central vertical crease on lower half of cover, which only slightly breaks colour on bottom couple of cms. Relatively minor wear at spine just breaks colour with an insignificant short reading crease. The right edge of the cover has a dust shadow (see scan). Interior covers are moderately tanned at edges, but there is no suggestion of brittleness. The grade has been assigned to recognise these defects. Pictured below\n\n\n21 VF £450 The Totally Amazing Spider-Man Collection. This is a clean and flat cents copy with a glossy cover, vivid colour and great reflectivity, square corners and virtually no wear. Supple pages are off-white to cream, staples are firm and tight at spine and centrefold. Just a tiny bit of wear along the top of the masthead, and miniscule chipping at lower edge; there is also a small arrival date in pen above the ‘the’ in the logo. Pictured below.\n\n21 VG- p £100 The Good Doctor Collection. Pence stamped. Some handling wear and minor creasing, both colour and non-colour breaking. Slight raggedness to some page edges on the right where the fold of the comic is not quite central and the second half slightly overlaps the first. Bright colours, some gloss, good staples and nice pages. Pictured below.\n\n22 CGC 8.5 VF+ £475 The Totally Amazing Spider-Man Collection.

Nice glossy copy with strong colour, pages and staples. A few spine ticks barely break colour, but there is a firm 13 cm crease across the top right corner which does break colour. Pictured below.\n\n23 VF- £430 The Totally Amazing Spider-Man Collection. 3rd Green Goblin. Includes a wonderful Ditko Spidey pin-up page. This is a beautiful copy with glowing colour and a pristine white background. Flat with square corners and only the most minimal signs of wear at corners and spine. We would have graded it even higher if not for a slight tanning round the edges of the inside covers, but the pages are supple and a nice off-white to cream. Pictured below.\n\n23 GD/VG p £90 Pence stamped. Solid spine with tight, firm staples, minimal wear at edges, colour-breaking crease across Spidey’s body and dust shadow along right edge with one small slight nick. Tanning to inner cover edges, but not brittle. Creamy coloured pages with occasional foxing mark in margin only. Pictured below\n\n\n24 VG p £100 The Good Doctor Collection. Pence stamped.

This mid-grade cents copy is reasonably appealing, with an intact if somewhat worn spine, but bright colours, firm staples and decent off-white to cream pages. Some corner blunting, a faint dust shadow across the very top edge, a little bit of handling wear and a minor crease or two, with only the shorter one breaking colour at bottom right corner. Pictured below.\n\n26 VF- £300 The Totally Amazing Spider-Man Collection. 1st Crime-Master. Great cover colour and gloss, unmarked. Staples tight and firm at spine and centrefold. Square corners, supple off-white pages. Very minimal wear, just very slight chipping to lower cover right edge and miniscule and infrequent spine ticks that are barely noticeable.

Pictured below\n\n28 VG- p £125 1st Molten Man. ‘Marvel Pop Art Productions’. iconic but notoriously infamous black background cover which traditionally shows up every imperfection. In that respect, this copy isn’t too bad. There is only minor wear at top, bottom and right edges, and although the spine has some reading wear where the black colour is broken, this is fairly unobtrusive. There is also a 4 cm fairly soft crease across bottom right cover edge which only slightly breaks colour. Staples are good and tight. Pages are off-white, turning slightly cream at the margin edges. The inside covers have tanned edges but are not brittle. Pictured below\n\n\n29 VG p £125 2nd Scorpion. ‘Marvel Pop Art Productions’. Pence printed, more than reasonable copy, with good cover colour and gloss, firm and tight staples, and creamy supple to slightly tan pages. A little corner blunting, but very little edge wear except for a very narrow chip out top right cover. There are a couple of diagonal creases across the centre of the cover which do not show strongly, and only very slightly break colour for a small part of their extent. The right edge of the cover has a dust shadow (see scan). Interior covers are tanned at edges, but there is no suggestion of brittleness. The grade has been assigned to recognise these defects.

A great cover, with Spidey trapped under impossibly heavy machinery as water splashes down all around. And that full page Ditko illustration inside, where, beset by worries about his aunt’s health, he exerts himself as never before to throw off the machinery — possibly my favourite Spidey moment! Not that you’ll see that with this CBCS issue unless you crack it open, but at least you can have the satisfaction of knowing that you have a true gem in your collection! Graded at 7.0 (FN/VF) by CBCS, this cents copy is unrestored with white pages and a perfect case. Pictured below.\n\n\n34 VG+ p £80 The Good Doctor Collection.

Staples are tight and firm at spine and centrefold, and pages are a supple off-white. As is not uncommon with this issue and often attributed to ballast wear, there is an uneveness around the lower part of the spine, like a wavy effect, but in this instance it is a lot less pronounced than on many copies we’ve seen. Some minor corner blunting, a short crease not breaking colour across the bottom right corner, and a very faint and slim white line on the lower brown brick in the cover image which does not appear to be a crease. Very minor edge wear. Overall, a copy that presents well for the grade. Pictured below.

This is a lowish grade pence-printed copy, but therefore relatively affordable. The cover colours are strong and the staples are tight and firm if a little rusty (with no rust migration). There are very short tears at the lower staple, but these are without any loss. There is also some corner blunting with wear at top and bottom spine. The spine itself is a little worn, but other edge wear is minimal. The cover image is very attractive with just a couple of short colour-breaking creases in the bottom right corner and a barely noticeable 10 com crease vertically down from the top edge; you can only see any faint colour-break in this for a few cms. Pages are a supple and very respectable off-white to cream. There are two or three very short tears on interior pages without loss (including pages 2/3 of the Dr Strange story). All in all, not a bad copy. Pictured below.\nHigh resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n\n112 VG- p £35 The Good Doctor Collection. 1st Eel.

One of the jewels in the crown of the Square Mile Collection, featuring the 5th ever Iron Man story in a vibrant VF/NM grade. Flat and tight with no creases and excellent staples, and just the merest hint of edge wear along the top and at the spine, but almost invisible. Glossy and refective with white to off-white pages, this must be virtually as nice as it was when it came off the presses in 1963. A great investment copy.

Glossy cover, superb page quality and minimal wear (highly unusual condition for a comic with a midnight blue background cover). Only a few minor spine ‘ticks’, slight blunting of some corners and a tiny insignificant chip out of centre back cover prevent a higher grade.\n\nTALES OF SUSPENSE #44 FN/VF\n\n47 GD- p £115 1st Melter. Pence printed, cover and spine worn with small colour-breaking creases. Staples attached throughout. Pages are okay with some wear and foxing at edges. Tanned edges to interior covers. A tired copy. Pictured below\n\n50 VG- p £320 1st Mandarin; nice colour, okay staples and pages and some corner blunting. Wear is restricted to the edges, where fine creases break colour, except for one long vertical crease down the centre which is quite faint and does not significantly break colour. There is the beginning of a small tear midway down the right cover edge. But it presents reasonably well.\n\nTALES OF SUSPENSE #50 VG-\n\n52 GD- p £225 1st Black Widow, 1st Crimson Dynamo II. Much wear and some colour-breaking creasing at the spine and edges, but with a mostly unspoilt central cover image. Three extra staples have been added (two near the originals), although it is unclear to what extent they are necessary. There is a very small chip out of the top edge and a tiny upper spine split. Page quality is quite decent. Pictured below.\n\n56 VF p £140 1st Unicorn; great cover colour and gloss, clean and bright, with only a couple of minor spine stress marks and tiny edge and corner wear; tight and flat with excellent staples and off-white pages; presents very well indeed.\n\nTALES OF SUSPENSE #56 VF\n\n57 VG- £300 1st Hawkeye. This nice cents copy is approaching mid-grade, with an unmarked cover with good colour and decent white background. Corners are a little blunted and there is minor wear at spine and edges. There are a couple of faint creases, barely breaking colour except gently at the spine and across the very edge of bottom right (Hawkeye’s foot). Staples are firm at spine and centrefold and the pages are a supple off-white. The most significant defect is a small piece of tape centre inner front cover sealing a 1 cm vertical tear which can barely be seen from the front. Pictured below.\n\n59 GD/VG p £115 Captain America series begins; 1st Jarvis. Pence stamped and structurally sound with good solid spine, tight staples and only minor edge wear. Cover has good colour and some gloss. Nice off-white to cream pages. The comic is marred by a long dust shadow down the right hand edge (see scan).

On this copy, that stamp has been overwritten with ‘6d’ in black marker (see scan). Otherwise there are minor colour-breaking creases in corners and edges, with a few white spine ticks.

    "html": " \nHome→Catalogue Index – Comics→DC\nDC\n\nWe list all comics individually from the Golden Age, Silver Age and up to approximately the end of the Bronze Age. For the most popular titles we extend the range into the 1980s or later.\n\n\n(A small ‘p’ after the grade denotes a UK distributed pence copy; after the direct market started, comics were dual-priced in cents and pence as distributed worldwide, with cents only copies being US newsstand, but we do not show direct market copies as pence.)\n\nFor DC Horror, War, Western, Romance & Teen Humour see the GENRES part of the catalogue\n\nAll Double Double Comics are listed under ‘D’\n\nA B C D E F G H I – J K L M N – Q R S T – V W – Z\n\nA\n\nACTION COMICS (1938)\n180 FA+ £33 Chip off lower cover, colour touch\n192 FA £30 Glued spine, colour touch lower edge\n\nACTION COMICS #192 FA\n\n197 VG- £85 Minor water mark lower right corner throughout book; small corner lower left cover missing.\n\nACTION #197 VG\n\n220 FA/GD £38 Small strip off lower right cover edge, chip out lower left cover edge\n223 FA/GD £25\n233 VG+ £87\n\nACTION COMICS #233 VG+\n\n236 VG- £75 Very small upper spine split; very slightly mis-cut; colour-breaking crease across bottom right cover corner; bright and attractive.\n\nACTION COMICS #236 VG-\n\n243 VG £54\n\nACTION #243 VG\n\n243 GD+ £29\n244 VG/FN £70\n\nACTION #244 VG/FN\n\n245 FN £80\n\nACTION #245 FN\n\n248 FA/GD £29 1st Congorilla. Glued spine. Wear, creases and tears with minor cover graffiti. Centrefold almost loose. Pictured below\n \n252 GD/VG £1,275 1st Supergirl, 1st Metallo. A lower to mid-grade copy, pre-distribution so cents of course. The cover image is bright and colourful and the comic presents reasonably well, with firm staples and decent cream coloured pages. Although the central cover image is unmarked, there are signs of reading wear at central right edge in the form of (probably) finger marks leading to smudgy creases which break colour over the tail fins of Supergirl’s rocket (see scan). The other significant flaw is a lower spine split of about 4 cm which extends throughout the pages to lesser degrees. Nevertheless, a good-looking copy of a major key issue which would be beyond a lot of collectors’ budgets if in much higher grade. High resolution images are available on request. \n\nACTION COMICS #252 GD/VG\n\nACTION COMICS #252 BACK\n\nACTION COMICS #252 SPLASH\n\n253 GD- £65 2nd Supergirl.

This is a truly fabulous high grade cents copy. Vibrant cover colour and gloss, totally unmarked, fresh and supple near white pages, clean staples tight and firm at spine and centrefold, square corners, looks unread and just off the newsstand. The only blemishes are a very faint 1.5 cm crease diagonally down from the lower staple which does not break colour and a couple of tiny pressure pinpoints just to the left of the 12 cents box. You’ll wait a long time to see a better copy of this conservatively graded milestone issue. As a dealer of 30+ years and a Legion fan of 60 years, I’ve never seen a nicer one. Pictured below.

A striking cover by Jerry Robinson, a reverse scene of the classic cover on #9, a Joker lead story The Joker Reforms by Bob Kane, two more mysteries drawn by Jack Burnley, before the final story by Kane again, debuting Alfred, Bruce Wayne’s butler, an integral part of the Batman family ever since and star of big and small screens. This of course is the fat Alfred before he got skinny as a result of a stay at a health resort not too long after. This is a sound copy of this landmark issue, with a rich, deep colour reflective cover almost entirely without markings or creases. There is a small mark above Robin’s head in the spotlight, which looks like a wax crayon mark as used by a US newsstand vendor. Very tiny bits of wear at top edge. Extremely tiny chip out 1 cm down from top of spine as part of an upper spine split of  about 3 cm. Neat spine tear around upper staple, but cover is still attached there. Other than that, staples are firm. Page quality is an excellent white to just off-white. Slight tanning to inside cover edges. One of the nicest copies of an early Batman I’ve ever seen. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n17 VG- £1.200 The Bute Collection. An iconic cover ny Jerry Robinson (signed as by Bob Kane) with Batman and Robin aloft upon an American Eagle against a black sky and yellow moon, encouraging us to: ‘Keep the American Eagle flying! Buy war bonds and stamps!’  Four Batman stories within, including a Penguin caper, with art by Bob Kane and Jack Burnley. This is a notoriously tough comic to get in decent grade due to the black cover, but this copy holds up pretty well. There is some wear with chips out along the bottom edge (nothing too serious, see images) and a tiny weeny colour-breaking crease across the bottom right corner. There is also a 2 cm tear at bottom edge below the moon which is barely noticeable and is without loss. Both staples are tight and firm and the pages are supple and a beautiful off-white. A long and a short indentation show on the inside front cover and only faintly show on the outside front cover when viewed from a certain angle. There are one of two other very faint lines on the front and back covers which do not break colour and perhaps suggest that the comic was used to rest on at some time in its history, but to the best of our knowledge there are no colour touches nor any restoration to the cover. Inside covers are tanned but not brittle. Certainly a remarkable copy. Pictured below.\nHigh resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n34 VG £360 The Bute Collection. Structurally, a very nice copy with bright colours and little wear (just slightly blunted corners and a tiny chip out at centre right edge). There is a tiny corner off one interior page (margin only). Staples are tight, firm and clean and comic lies flat. Page quality is an excellent and very supple off-white. The grade is kept to VG due to enthusiastic signatures in pen by a previous owner in four places on the cover (over the backgrounds rather than the figures) and further such incursions on inside page margins. Pictured below.\n\n58 INCOMPLETE £100 Features a Penguin cover and lead story, classic ‘State-Bird Crimes’. ‘Returned’ copy, where the logo was cut off an unsold copy and returned by the newsvendor for credit. The rest of the cover has bright colours and a solid image, but the covers are detached from the comic. Small split at base of spine. Staples tight at centrefold. Page quality quite decent although top of splash page is a little mottled where it has been exposed. Benefits from logo on splash page being in a similar position to the missing cover logo. All pages complete and present. Pictured below\n\n102 FA £34 Long horizontal cover tear, sealed with tape from the inside.\n105 FA+ £85 2nd Batwoman. This is a low grade copy with lengthy colour touches at the spine, which is split upper 3.5 cm. Cover colours are quite strong, but there are plenty of colour-breaking creases and moderate edge wear with a fingernail-size chip out of top centre cover. Staples are okay if a tad rusty and pages are creamy but flexible. Long diagonal crease on back cover. Pictured below\n\n106 PR £18 Heacy tape around all cover edges, small corner off bottom right.

Solid copy with good colour, pages and staples. Tiny splits at either end of spine. A few tiny creases in bottom right cover corner break colour. Pictured below.\n\n28 VG- p £1,700 1st Justice League Of America. This is a decent (unobtrusively) stamped pence copy, pretty solid with some Marvel chipping (how ironic!) along the right edge, but very minor. A short diagonal crease across the right bottom cover corner breaks colour for a few cms. The cover colours are strong and the staples are tight and firm at the spine (the lower only being off at centrefold). Page quality is a nice off-white to cream; some corner blunting, but nothing too bad. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n\n28 PR p £750 1st Justice League Of America. This copy is only a Poor. Most noticeably, it has a heavily taped spine and is missing the back cover. The staples are good at the centrefold, but it is difficult to think they have any effect on the cover. The colours on the front cover are a bit muted, but not too bad. Lots of wear beneath the spine tape and lots of edge ‘nibbles’, with the cover quite worn and thin. Pence stamped. Page quality is okay, a little grubby here and there with small horizontal tear centre right edge of last two pages. All pages are present. The cheapest copy I can see around at the time of listing. Pictured below. High resolution images are available on request.\n\n\n\n29 GD+ £175 The Bute Collection. 1st Weapons Master. Nice cover image with good colour and some gloss. A name is written in pen in the ‘G’ of ‘League’ in the logo. The spine is split almost halfway up from the bottom and thus the cover is off bottom staple; it looks like tape had been used to seal it, but this has now been removed, leaving a brown stain which is almost all on the back cover. Upper staple is firm at spine and both staples firm at centrefold. Supple pages are off-white to cream. Presents well, with only minor corner blunting and a few tiny edge creases which do not break colour. Pictured below\n\n38 VG+ p £35 The Bute Collection. Suicide Squad.

A low grade pence-stamped copy, superficially nice with good colour and an unmarked cover. However, there is a jagged v-shaped tear of approx 8 cm at the lower spine, with a split from its begiining to the bottom of the spine, thus the front cover is off bottom staple. The spine is worn with a small upper split as well, and there is also edge wear and some chipping at bottom right corner. Top staple is well-attached and both staples are firm at centrefold. Pages are a decent off-white to cream. Despite the faults, this presents quite well. From an original owner collection and new to the marketplace.

This wonderful copy has vibrant colour and brilliant gloss, showing off Neal Adams’ work at its best. There is a faint pence stamp over the ‘1’ beside the logo. There are some very small stress lines at staples and at the spine, but these do not break colour. Square corners, firm staples, lovely supple white to offr-white pages. There is a soft, faint crease from the bottom edge up to Superman’s ankle, but this barely shows and does not break colour. All in all, a gem of a copy.

In these early days for the title, Superman and Batman appeared in separate stories and had a variety of back-ups, in this case the Star-Spangled Kid, the Boy Commandos (by Simon & Kirby), Green Arrow and Zatara, an all-star line-up in its giant 84 pages. The firm cardboard covers on these early issues helps keep them in a good state or preservation, as is the case here. Apart from a small grubby mark or two, the cover is flat and clean; one small crease at spine does not break colour. The spine is solid, with just a tiny tear at the base. The inside pages are firmly attached (except that the final page is detached from the single central staple, which is otherwise secure). Pages are a supple cream, with just hints of tan at the extremities.

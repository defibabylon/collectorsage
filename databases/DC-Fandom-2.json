Years of training have made her stealthy and agile as a world-class criminal, and her mastery of martial arts makes her a formidable physical opponent. Although she began her career as a burglar, she has since then reformed and begun protecting Gotham City in her own style. This has led to her being almost completely accepted as a regular member of the Batman Family. She has also been a member of the Birds of Prey, the Outsiders, the Gotham City Sirens, the Injustice League, the Justice League and the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Her close friend Holly Robinson acted as her successor for an extended period when Selina was out of commission. In Prime Earth continuity, Eiko Hasigawa assumed the Catwoman mantle during a time in which Selina was serving as a crime boss.\n\nCatwoman was created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, first appearing in Batman #1 (1940).\n\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-Two\nGolden Age\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-One\nSilver Age\nSelina Kyle\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nHolly Robinson\nNew Earth\nSuccessor\nEiko Hasigawa\nPrime Earth\nSuccessor\nCatgirl\nNew Earth\n(other versions)\nContents\n1\tMultiverse\n1.1\tNew 52 Multiverse\n1.2\tDark Multiverse\n1.3\tPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\n1.4\tPre-Crisis Multiverse\n1.5\tHypertime\n1.6\tElseworlds\n1.7\tAlternate Timelines\n1.8\tPossible Futures\n2\tOther media\n2.1\tDCAU\n2.2\tLego Dimensions\n2.3\tInjustice Multiverse\n2.4\tTomorrowverse\n2.5\tDC Super Hero Girls\n2.6\tArrowverse\n2.7\tOthers\n3\tComics\n4\tOther Media Titles\nMultiverse\nNew 52 Multiverse\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 1\nBatman: Earth One\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 2\nWonders of the World\nSelina Calabrese\nEarth 3\nInfinite Frontier\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth 6\nJust Imagine...\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond 2.0\nCatwoman II\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond Unlimited\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 19\nGotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 21\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 22\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth 22\nKingdom Come\nSelina Digatti\nEarth 24\nDC Bombshells\nFelina\nEarth 31\nLeatherwing\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 37\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 49\nInjustice\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 50\nJustice Lords\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 55\nDCeased\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 63\nDC vs. Vampires\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 66\nBatman '66\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 96\nDC Super Hero Girls\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 789\nBurtonverse\nCatsai\nEarth 1996\nCatwoman/Elektra\nSelina Luthor\nEarth 1996\nCatwoman/Viper\nSelina\nAbsolute Universe\nAbsolute Batman\nSelina Kyle\nReality Undetermined\nThe Bat-Man of Gotham\nDark Multiverse\nSylvester Kyle\nEarth -11\nThe Drowned\nSelina Kyle\nEarth -22\nThe Batman Who Laughs\nSelina Kyle\nDark Multiverse\nBlackest Night\nSelina Kyle\nDark Multiverse\nCrisis on Infinite Earths\nPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\nBizarro Catwoman\nNew Earth\nBizarro World\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1\nBatman: Earth One\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-21\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-22\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth-22\nKingdom Come\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth-27\nJust Imagine\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-31\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nStar Sapphire\nEarth-32\nIn Darkest Knight\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-37\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-43\nBloodstorm\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-85\nBatman: League of Batmen\nCatsai\nEarth-496\nCatwoman/Elektra\nSelina Luthor\nEarth-496\nCatwoman/Viper\nSelina Kyle\nEarth Whatever\nWaking Up on the Wrong Side of the Universe\nMaggie Kyle\nEarth Whatever\nWaking Up on the Wrong Side of the Universe\nPre-Crisis Multiverse\nKathy Kane\nEarth-One\nCatman's woman\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-Forty\nGolden Age newspaper strip\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-61\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-260\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-686\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth-901\nJust Imagine\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1191\nBatman: Bloodstorm\nHypertime\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-96\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth-96\nKingdom Come\nCapitana Felina\nEarth-494\nLeatherwing\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-508\nDC Super Friends\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-898\nThe Nail\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1099\nCatwoman: Guardian of Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-5050\nSecret Society of Super-Heroes\nElseworlds\nSheila Romero\nElseworlds\nDigital Justice\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nNine Lives\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nDetective No. 27\nTalia al Ghul\nElseworlds\nThe Last Man\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nSuper Seven\nVikki Vale\nElseworlds\nThe Tyrant\nCatwoman\nElseworlds\nThe Narrow Path\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCurse of the Cat-Woman\nKhefretari\nElseworlds\nClaws of the Cat-Woman\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCitizen Wayne\nKitty Grimalkin\nElseworlds\nDark Allegiances\nCat Majik\nElseworlds\nHaunted Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nTwo Faces\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nGotham Noir\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nVigilantes in Apartment 3B\nCatwoman\nElseworlds\nA Tragedy\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCreated Equal\nThe Cat\nElseworlds\nGolden Streets of Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nElseworld's Finest\nSelina Kyle\nLil Gotham\nLil Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nShadow of Sin Tzu\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nBatman: Noël\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nAme-Comi Girl\nSelina Kyle\nScooby-Doo\nScooby-Doo!

Premiering on HBO Max in 2024, it follows a black ops team of monsters performing missions for A.R.G.U.S. after Task Force X is shut down.\n\nThe series was praised by critics for its writing, animation, and vocal performances. It is the first official project in the DC Universe, though its premiere follows up on the retroactively canonical events of Peacemaker Season 1 (2022).\n\nContents\n1\tPlot synopsis\n2\tCast\n2.1\tStarring\n2.2\tRecurring\n3\tEpisodes\n3.1\tSeason 1\n4\tProduction\n4.1\tDevelopment\n4.2\tProduction on Season 1\n4.3\tProduction on Season 2\n5\tTrivia\n6\tExternal links\n7\tReferences\nPlot synopsis\n\nAfter the Task Force X program is shut down,[4] A.R.G.U.S. director Amanda Waller is no longer allowed to blackmail human supervillains for covert ops missions. To circumvent these restrictions, she puts together a new team of non-human individuals, known as the Creature Commandos, to perform her clandestine operations under the leadership of General Rick Flag Sr.[5]\n\nCast\nStarring\nIndira Varma as the Bride[6]\nFrank Grillo as General Rick Flag Sr.[6]\nZoë Chao as Nina Mazursky[6]\nAlan Tudyk as Dr. Alex Sartorius/Doctor Phosphorus[6]\nSean Gunn as G.I.

Animation if he wanted to make an animated project, and Gunn suggested a series based on the Creature Commandos. He wrote all seven episodes,[10] and when he became DC Studios' creative head in 2022, he greenlit the series for his new DC Universe.[11]\n\nEach episode focuses on a different team member, which Gunn likened to Lost.[6] The show's takes on Frankenstein's monster and the Bride are largely derived from the original novel Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley, as opposed to Universal Pictures' classic film adaptations, or Grant Morrison's reinterpretation of Frankenstein for DC Comics in their Seven Soldiers of Victory maxi-series.[2]\n\nProduction on Season 1\n\nGunn announced the series in January 2023 as part of his announcement of the wider DC Studios slate,[12] and the main cast was announced in April 2023.[6] The cast recorded their lines for the first season from May[13] to August of that year,[14] with Gunn serving as voice director for the main actors.[15]\n\nDean Lorey served as showrunner on Season 1, while Yves Bigerel acted as supervising director for the animation studio Bobbypills.[16] The show was scored by Clint Mansell and Kevin Kiner, who previously scored music for the DC series Titans, Doom Patrol, and Gunn's own Peacemaker.[10] The show's theme song is a cover of \"Moliendo Café\" performed by Fanfare Ciocărlia,[16] and several licensed songs from bands such as Gogol Bordello and The Dresden Dolls are included in the series.[17]\n\nProduction on Season 2\n\nIn December 2024, Creature Commandos was renewed for a second season,[18] and Gunn announced that work on it had begun in January 2025.[19]\n\nTrivia\nCreature Commandos is the first project in \"Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters\", the first wave of projects in the DC Universe.[12]\nThe series premiere follows up on the retroactively canonical events of The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker Season 1.\nNone of the original comics' Commandos star in the show, though many share similarities with the initial roster, such as Rick Flag Sr. standing in for Matthew Shrieve, Weasel for Wolfpack, and Eric Frankenstein for Lucky Taylor.\nExternal links\nCreature Commandos at the DC Universe Wiki\nCreature Commandos (TV series) at Wikipedia.org\nReferences\n↑ DC Slate Unveiled: New Batman, Supergirl Movies, a Green Lantern TV Show, and More from James Gunn, Peter Safran – The Hollywood Reporter\n↑ 2.0 2.1 James Gunn on how Creature Commandos kicks off his new DC universe – Entertainment Weekly\n↑ Max Original Adult Animated Series Creature Commandos, From DC Studios, Debuts December 5 – WBD.com\n↑ Peacemaker: \"It's Cow or Never\"\n↑ Creature Commandos Official Trailer – YouTube\n↑ 6.00 6.01 6.02 6.03 6.04 6.05 6.06 6.07 6.08 6.09 6.10 Here's the Full Cast of DC's Creatures Commandos – Collider\n↑ @jamesgunn on Threads (January 14, 2024)\n↑ Julian Kostov (visual voices guide)\n↑ Here Are the Biggest Easter Eggs in Creature Commandos Episode 4 – Collider\n↑ 10.0 10.1 James Gunn Reveals What's Still Canon in the DCU and Discusses Creature Commandos, the Next Batman, Superman, and More – Collider\n↑ James Gunn on Creature Commandos and Killing Nazis in His New DC Universe – YouTube\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters Announcement – YouTube\n↑ Sean Gunn Reveals DC's Creature Commandos Has Begun Production – Comicbook.com\n↑ James Gunn Confirms How Many Episodes DC's Creature Commandos Will Be – Comicbook.com\n↑ James Gunn Reveals Bigger Role In Upcoming DCU Release – ScreenRant\n↑ 16.0 16.1 Creature Commandos Preview Shows Some Downsides To James Gunn's DC Universe (Annecy) – Slashfilm\n↑ DC's Creature Commandos, Previewed in Annecy, Echoes James Gunn's Unmistakable Voice – Variety\n↑ DC's Creature Commandos Renewed for Season 2 – Variety\n↑ James Gunn on Bluesky (January 29, 2025)\nCategories\nLanguages\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Horror Sci-fi DC\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCookies Settings\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nDC Database is a FANDOM Comics Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE"

September 1, 1927 – d.August 3, 2016) was a comic book letterer.\n\nContents\n1\tProfessional History\n2\tPersonal History\n3\tWork History\n4\tExternal Links\n5\tReferences\nProfessional History\n\nGaspar Saladino was a professional comic book letterer. He worked for DC Comics since the 50's during the Golden and Silver Ages of Comics as a freelance letterer. He became the main letterer for the company after Ira Schnapp's removal under Carmine Infantino's instructions. Saladino would also work as a freelancer for Marvel Comics during the 60's, but he remained a constant employee of DC Comics. His most notorious work is probably on the critically acclaimed graphic novel, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, by Grant Morrison, in which he provided a different type of letter to each character. He was also responsible for designing some of the company's logos during the 60's and 70's.\n\nSaladino worked as a letterer for DC until the 90's and he then worked on the Vertigo imprint during the early 2000's. However, his output after 2002 was minimal.\n\nSaladino passed away on August 3, 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nPersonal History\n\nHe was born in the borough of Brooklyn on September 1, 1927[1] and attended Manhattan's School of Industrial Art. After graduating from high school, Saladino enlisted in the U.S. Army.\n\nWork History\nGaspar Saladino/Cover Artist\nGaspar Saladino/Letterer\nGaspar Saladino's Images as a Cover Artist\nGaspar Saladino's Images as a Letterer\n\n\n\n\nExternal Links\nGaspar Saladino at DCComics.com\nGaspar Saladino at Wikipedia.org\nGaspar Saladino at Marvel Database\nReferences\n↑ https://kleinletters.com/Blog/gaspar-saladinos-first-lettering-for-dc-comics-part-1/\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Horror Sci-fi DC\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecent Images\nSergeant Harp (Fables)\n2 hours ago\nTeth-Adam (Prime Earth)/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nAmazons of Paradise Island/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew releases\n\nCheck out the new comics, collections and more this week.\n\nWant to help out?\n\nWrite an issue synopsis\n\nWrite a character bio\n\nCatalog character appearances\n\nSee our Manual of Style, Policy and our Template Help page\n\nJoin the Discord community!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCookies Settings\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nDC Database is a FANDOM Comics Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"

They have two representatives for each of the 3600 sectors in the known universe, their headquarters located centrally on the planet Oa.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tOrigins\n1.2\tManhunter Failure\n1.3\tCreation of the Corps\n1.4\tCrisis and Aftermath\n1.5\tFall of the Green Lantern Corps\n1.6\tRebirth of the Corps\n1.7\tSinestro Corps War\n1.8\tRise of the Lantern Corps\n1.9\tBlackest Night\n1.10\tWar of the Green Lanterns\n2\tParaphernalia\n3\tNotes\n3.1\tStructure\n3.1.1\tThe 3600 sectors\n3.1.2\tCrimson Mantle of Command and Corps Leader\n3.2\tDepartments\n4\tTrivia\n5\tSee Also\n6\tRecommended Reading\n7\tLinks\n7.1\tFootnotes\nHistory\nOrigins\n\nIn the early days of the Universe, natives of the overpopulated planet Maltus evolved into immortals of great power. They subsequently settled the planet Oa and declared themselves the Guardians of the Universe and enemies of evil after one of their own, the renegade scientist Krona, performed a forbidden experiment that had terrible consequences for the Universe at large.\n\n\nExactly what those consequences were have varied with different versions of the stories; originally, it was supposed to have unleashed Evil in the first place. Later, it was attributed to have created the Antimatter Universe of Qward. Later still, it was used as the explanation for the existence of parallel universes in the DC Universe (and the creation of the Monitor), which eventually led to the rearrangement of Time itself, as seen in the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Finally, it has been stated that it accelerated entropy, shortening the duration of the universe by a billion years.[1]\n\nSome of the Guardians, however, disagreed on how to deal with the chaos that had been unleashed. One group, calling itself the Controllers, separated itself from the others and favored using more violent methods to achieve their ends. They would later found the Darkstars organization. The female Oans, feeling no need to involve themselves in the situation, also left, becoming later known as the Zamarons.\n\nManhunter Failure\n\nTo enforce their will and guard against alien menaces of all sorts, the Guardians had created a legion of robotic sentinels called the Manhunters about 3.5 billion years ago. The Manhunters eventually came to resent their servitude and were also viewed as flawed due to their inability to recognize and/or feel fear at all. They rebelled against the Guardians and fought a millennia long war that culminated with an attack on the planet Oa. Ultimately, the Guardians overcame their android servants, stripping them of their power and banishing them across the universe. Eventually, they formed their own robotic society where they pursued their own agenda (which often included interfering with and foiling the plans of the Guardians).\n\nCreation of the Corps\n\nChastened by the failure of the Manhunters, the Guardians decided that their newest force of soldiers for good would consist of living beings, ones who had free will and strong moral character. To arm this new legion of celestial knights, the Guardians created the Power Rings, rings of inconceivably-advanced technology that allowed their wearers to project green beams of energy with which the bearer could conjure objects of any size or shape, limited only by his or her imagination and willpower.\n\nAlthough the connection between the Guardian Oans and the origin of the Green Lantern symbol has yet to be clarified, it has been revealed that the lantern itself has its roots in the first life in the universe. Allegedly, the first life in the galaxy emerged on an unnamed foggy world, and when they developed a police force—the first in the universe—the constabulary carried a lantern lit with a green chemical flame, hence a corp of Green Lanterns. It is believed that this ideal was adopted and spread throughout the galaxy as a symbol for law and justice and its ability to pierce confusion and uncertainty, eventually resulting in the formation of the Green Lantern Corps, with requisite power rings and lantern-shaped batteries along traditional lines. Initially consisting of only a few dozen agents at a time, the Corps radically increased its numbers approximately 1000 years ago. The Guardians sought to bring order to the planet known as Apokolips. Home to Darkseid, a galactic tyrant, Apokolips was and is a stronghold of evil. Green Lantern Raker Qarrigat sought to remove Darkseid from power, only to be humbled by Darkseid's might. Raker returned to Oa, where he convinced the Guardians that taking Apokolips would require an army. Authorized to start a massive recruitment, Raker and his fellow Lanterns inducted thousands of new members, bringing total membership up to 3600.\n\nCrisis and Aftermath\n\nBoth the Corps and the Guardians suffered casualties during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. The Guardians' failure to take appropriate action during the Crisis led to their decision to depart Oa in the company of their female counterparts, the Zamarons.[2] Left to their own devices, the Corps underwent a major reorganization. A team of Green Lanterns led by Hal Jordan was stationed on Earth,[3] and the system of assigning one Green Lantern to a sector was temporarily abandoned. The decision of the Corps to execute Thaal Sinestro resulted in the activation of a previously unknown fail-safe that depowered the rings of every Green Lantern except for Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, G'nort and Ch'p.[4]\n\nWith their numbers deeply limited, the Green Lantern Corps fell into a period of inactivity. The Guardians eventually returned to Oa and began the reconstruction of the Corps, assigning Guy Gardner to Earth, John Stewart to the Mosaic World, and Hal Jordan to recruit new members.[5] Ironically, Jordan himself would eventually be responsible for destroying the incarnation of the Corps that he had helped create.\n\nFall of the Green Lantern Corps\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps patrolled the DC Universe for over three billion years. In that vast length of time, some Green Lanterns rebelled and fell into evil. A rogue Green Lantern, Universo, was briefly shown to exist in the future epoch of the Legion of Super-Heroes, but multiple retcons have long since eliminated this possible future. Two of the most important rebels were Sinestro, the rogue Green Lantern, and Hal Jordan, driven insane over the loss of his home, Coast City, and possession by Parallax.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps ranks were decimated by Hal Jordan during his madness, its power source, the Main Battery, extinguished; and Oa destroyed, removing the original power source for the rings.\n\nAfter the second fall of the Corps, other organizations tried to fill in the power vacuum left by the Guardians. Two organizations had initial notable successes; the Darkstars and L.E.G.I.O.N. However neither ever achieved the power and reach of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nRebirth of the Corps\n\nOa was reconstructed by Hal Jordan's old sidekick Tom Kalmaku, and shortly thereafter Kyle Rayner, the last remaining Green Lantern, resurrected the Guardians as children using the power Parallax had stolen. The resurrections did not stop there. It was discovered that Hal Jordan had committed his crimes while possessed by the ancient fear parasite Parallax. Parallax had been imprisoned within the Central Power Battery for billions of years and is the mysterious \"Yellow Impurity\" within the Corps' green light that leaves them vulnerable against yellow. Once Parallax had been exorcised, the now adult Guardians re-imprisoned Parallax. With that, the Guardians continued the re-construction and expansion of the Corps. The new Corps, under the training of Kilowog, Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner and other veterans, was primarily filled by new recruits. Only a handful of veteran Lanterns are back in the ranks. Each sector will have two Lanterns assigned to protect it. Due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild the Vega star system is off limits to all members of the Corps.\n\nWith 3600 sectors and two Green Lanterns per sector, it will be many years before the Green Lantern Corps regains its former strength. It presently lacks both the manpower and the political influence it once had due to its years-long absence from many sectors. This has left it unable to intervene in situations it might have before Parallax destroyed the old Corps, including conflicts such as the Rann-Thanagar War. The Guardians remain staunchly uninvolved in what they see as a conflict that could destabilize many sectors, but that has not stopped Kyle Rayner and Kilowog from helping refugees.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the Corps played a key role in defeating Superboy-Prime. Several Lanterns were killed slowing the renegade Superboy's advance on Oa, a sacrifice that enabled Earth's most powerful heroes to execute their plan to restrain him. Mogo, the sentient planet and Corps member, positioned himself to act as a final battleground between Superboy-Prime and the two Supermen. The Corps took responsibility for imprisoning Superboy-Prime, incarcerating him inside a small red Sun-Eater with fifty Green Lanterns on constant guard duty. \"Prime Duty\" is considered one of the lowlier functions of the Corps, as \"constant\" is taken to the most literal sense of the word: there is no sleeping, consuming of nutrition, excremental waste, or talking, as the Ring is to supply and maintain all bodily functions. Guy Gardner was sentenced to a month of such duty for one of his frequent rules infractions.\n\nAs of the \"One Year Later\" time frame, the Green Lantern Corps has increased its numbers, with many former trainees now full-fledged officers. The lack of truly experienced GLs remains an issue, with Guy Gardner being called upon often to assist the rookies. The transformation of Kyle Rayner to Ion also holds unknown ramifications for the future of the Corps.\n\nSinestro Corps War\n\nRogue Green Lantern Sinestro, working with the Anti-Monitor, has created his own version of the Corps. Dubbed the \"Sinestro Corps\", it recruits beings capable of generating great fear. Armed with yellow Power Rings and Lanterns manufactured on Qward, the Sinestro Corps recently staged an attack on Oa, killing dozens of GLC officers, kidnapping Kyle Rayner and freeing Superboy-Prime, Parallax and the Cyborg Superman from the Corps' supervision.\n\nAs the Sinestro Corps' campaign of terror spreads, the Guardians, in desperation, rewrite the first Law of Ten in the Book of Oa, enabling the remaining Lanterns to use lethal force. When the Sinestro Corps gathered for an assault on Earth, the Green Lantern Corps and Earth's Superheroes united to fight off the invasion force. Eventually, during the Battle of New York, Guy Gardner and John Stewart used Warworld and it's mobile Power Battery as a weapon against the Anti-Monitor, with the Green Lanterns throwing up a shield to contain the Anti-Monitor and the explosion. The Anti-Monitor and Cyborg Superman were both seriously injured in the explosion, and Superboy-Prime then betrayed the Anti-Monitor, hurling him away from Earth. At Coast City, Hal Jordan was able to free Kyle Rayner from Parallax's control, and he was imprisoned in the Earth Lanterns power batteries. During the Sinestro Corps subsequent invasion of Coast City, Hal and Kyle were able to defeat and arrest Sinestro, ending the Sinestro Corp War.\n\nRise of the Lantern Corps\n\nFollowing the Sinestro Corps War, the Guardians, under the leadership of the Scarred Guardian, began taking new measures to prevent the Blackest Night from occurring. The Guardians established the Alpha-Lantern Corps as an internal affairs force to investigate any abuses of power or dereliction of duty. The Alpha Lanterns were subjected to invasive surgery that essentially made them Lantern Manhunter hybrids. Following this, the Guardians authorized lethal force against all enemies of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nMeanwhile, Qwardian rings continued to search for new bearers across the galaxy, one of which made their way to Mongul II. He tried to take over the Sinestro Corps in their time of weakness. A team of Lanterns under Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner, on a search for the remaining Qwardian rings, discovered Mongul and managed to defeat him, leaving him for dead, though he escaped soon after. At the same time, the Guardians were aware of the Zamarons experiments into the Violet light to form the Star Sapphire Corps. After a failed diplomatic mission, the Guardians established a new rule forbidding romantic relationships between members of the Green Lantern Corps. This act backfired on the Guardians, as dozens of Green Lantern couples resigned in protest.\n\nHaving been on death row since the end of the war, Sinestro was eventually ordered to be transferred to Korugar for execution. A team of Green Lanterns, including Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Kilowog, and Salakk, oversaw the transfer, only to come under ambush by the Sinestro Corps, who had been informed of the transfer by the Scarred Guardian. However, the Sinestro Corps were themselves ambushed by the Red Lantern Corps under Atrocitus, seeking to capture Sinestro for himself. The Green Lanterns were left for dead, their rings corrupted by the rage of the Red Lanterns. However, they in turn were rescued by Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps.\n\nBlackest Night\n\nHidden in the Book of Oa is the forbidden chapter of Cosmic Revelations, which contains a prophecy called the \"Blackest Night\". In the prophecy, seven different colored corps are at war with each other, eventually destroying one another and the universe.\n\nFollowing the Sinestro Corps War, Ganthet and Sayd are banished from the Guardians. Realizing that the \"Blackest Night\" prophecy will come to be, they create a blue ring powered by hope. The remaining Guardians create the Alpha-Lanterns and reveal new laws they've written to the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nDuring the Blackest Night, the Guardians finally realize the accuracy of the prophecy and are imprisoned by the Scarred Guardians; who launches an attack on the Corps by reviving deceased members as Black Lanterns. Command falls to Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, and Salakk, a senior Lantern holding the rank of Clarissi.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps is forced to make an alliance with the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lantern Corps, the Indigo Tribe, the Blue Lantern Corps, Agent Orange, and the Star Sapphire Corps to fight the Black Lanterns to maintain peace and order across the universe.\n\nThe leader of the Black Lanterns is revealed to be Nekron, the physical manifestation of death. Nekron's plan is to find the White Entity, the physical embodiment of life and destroy it, thereby destroying all life in the universe.\n\nThe Blackest Night ends when Hal Jordan, merged with the White Entity, and the recently created White Lantern Corps defeat Nekron and banish him from the realm of the living.\n\nWar of the Green Lanterns\n\nAfter the Blackest Night, Hal Jordan forms a loose alliance with Carol Ferris, Atrocitus, Sinestro, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and Indigo-1 to find and protect the emotional entities, who have been kidnapped by a mysterious villain. The kidnapper is revealed to be Krona, who is also revealed to be the one who caused the Manhunters to go on a rampage in the first place.\n\nCarol, Sinestro, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Larfleeze and Indigo-1 are trapped within the Book of the Black. However, Hal escapes and takes their rings. Krona begins the next stage of his plan, using the Guardians as the entities's hosts. He also places Parallax back into the Central Power Battery, restoring the yellow impurity and brainwashing all the Green Lanterns into serving him. However, Hal, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, and Kilowog have a measure of resistance, due to their previous experience with fear. The other Lantern unaffected by the yellow impurity is Ganthet.\n\nKillowog is captured by Krona, and his resistance to brainwashing overcome. To prevent Krona from controlling them, the Earthmen take off their Green Lantern rings and put on the rings Hal rescued from the Book of the Black. Hal takes the Sinestro Corps ring, Guy takes the Red Lantern ring, John takes the Indigo Tribe ring, and Kyle takes the Blue Lantern ring. Hal, John, Guy and Kyle go to the Central Power Battery to remove Parallax and restore the Corps to normal. However, an ambush from the brainwashed Lanterns separates the group. Hal and Guy end up captured by the Guardians, while Kyle and John travel to Mogo with the intention of freeing it from Krona's control.\n\nHowever, John and Kyle are attacked by Lanterns while they travel to Mogo's core. John harnesses the Black Lantern energy left in Mogo and uses it to destroy Mogo. This allows Hal and Guy to escape from Krona's forces and re-group with John and Kyle. The four Lanterns and Ganthet go to the Battery, where Hal wields the Agent Orange ring while Guy wields the Star Sapphire ring. Hal, John, Kyle and Ganthet fight the brainwashed Lanterns while Guy removes Parallax from the Battery, restoring the Corps.\n\nWith the impurity removed, Hal, John, Kyle and Guy recover their Green Lantern rings and join the Corps in the final battle against Krona and the entity-possessed Guardians.\n\nDuring the final struggle, Hal and Kyle free Carol, Sinestro and the others from the Book of the Black. Also, Sinestro becomes a Green Lantern once again. Hal kills Krona, releasing the entities from the Guardians. However, the Guardians believe Hal to be the most dangerous Green Lantern, so they discharge him from the Corps.\n\nParaphernalia\n\nEquipment: The Corps possess the weapons of willpower to enforce peace and order throughout the universe.\n\nGreen Lantern Power Ring\nGreen Lantern Power Battery\nCentral Power Battery of Oa\nBook of Oa\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nTotal Sectors: 3600\nTotal Members: 7200\nStructure\nThe 3600 sectors\n\nThe Corps is an organization of 7200 Green Lanterns (the old Corps had 3600) who are chosen by the ring for being able to overcome great fear, with two assigned to sectors of space that require the protection of more than one Green Lantern (Earth, home to Hal Jordan and John Stewart, is in Sector 2814). Heavily populated Sectors like 2814 can have several Lanterns. While the primary Lanterns of Sector 2814 are Hal Jordan and John Stewart, Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner call Earth home, but are stationed on Oa, first as teachers, and then specially assigned to cases that are too difficult for the average GL.\n\nEach member has a great deal of autonomy as to their methods in their jurisdiction, subject to review by the Guardians if they feel the Green Lantern in question has abused his/her assigned authority. The individual Lanterns are responsible for arranging their replacements if they are near retirement or death. If the Lantern dies before that obligation is met, the ring will find and seek another to be trained on its own. In rare circumstances, Guardians will personally go out into the field to recruit a replacement.\n\nUpon recruitment each Green Lantern in the original Corps received a Power Ring, a Power Battery shaped like a lantern (with which the ring is recharged), and a uniform. The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots, white gloves, green domino mask and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle. Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms as long as the color scheme and the symbol were present. When the nature of the being precludes a standard uniform, an equivalent arrangement is expected as a substitute. For instance, Mogo, a sentient planet, arranges his foliage to create a green circling band and lantern symbol on his body. Jack T. Chance, a humanoid, refused to wear a uniform, but conceded to wearing a badge on the lapel of his coat. Lanterns were also allowed the option of a secret identity as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them. Training in the use of the ring was optional and appropriate facilities and personnel were available on Oa upon request. In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit while in the field in their sector.\n\nThe New Green Lantern Corps being built by the Guardians is far more formal and structured than the old one that was destroyed by Parallax. Recruits, after being found by their Power Rings, are taken to Oa for training. Not all recruits will make it through training—indeed a great many of them might even fail, forcing the ring to find another candidate. Lantern trainees have a simplified version of the old Green Lantern uniform (with green covering more of the torso) with the white circle on their chest blank, presumably until the Lantern insignia is added upon completion of their training. Additionally, all Power Rings, not just Kyle Rayner's ring, now work on the color yellow, provided the user can feel the fear behind the color and overcome it.\n\nCrimson Mantle of Command and Corps Leader\n\nAfter helping the Corps defeat Krona and Nekron, Hal Jordan is offered \"The Crimson Mantle of Command, symbol of those who would become Corps Leader!\" Jordan declines the honor, on the grounds that he is no different than any other Lantern.[6]\n\nThe normal chain of command beneath the Guardians is the Clarissi or protocol lantern, normally Salaak, then the Illustres or honor guards, Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner.\n\nDepartments\nAlpha-Lantern Corps\nThe Corpse\nGreen Lantern Honor Guard\nTrivia\nThe Corps' oath was first recited in Green Lantern #14.\nSee Also\n403 Appearances of Green Lantern Corps (New Earth)\n108 Images that include Green Lantern Corps (New Earth)\nOrganization Gallery: Green Lantern Corps (New Earth)\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n Main article: Green Lantern Recommended Reading\n\nLinks\nIon Entity\nFootnotes\n↑ Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale\n↑ Green Lantern (Volume 2) #200\n↑ Green Lantern Corps #201\n↑ Green Lantern Corps #222–#224\n↑ Green Lantern (Volume 3) #13\n↑ Tales of the Green Lantern Corps #3\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Horror Sci-fi DC\nRecent Images\nSergeant Harp (Fables)\n2 hours ago\nTeth-Adam (Prime Earth)/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nAmazons of Paradise Island/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nDeals on \nFanatical is a Fandom brand.\nThe following products are sponsored.\nLEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham\n-80%\n$19.99\n$3.99\nScribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure\n-88%\n$2.49\nInjustice 2\n-92%\n$4.12\nInjustice: Gods Among Us - Ultimate Edition\n-88%\n$2.49\nLEGO DC Super-Villains\n-88%\n$4.99\nSuicide Squad: Kill The Justice League\n-92%\n$5.77\nNew releases\n\nCheck out the new comics, collections and more this week.\n\nWant to help out?\n\nWrite an issue synopsis\n\nWrite a character bio\n\nCatalog character appearances\n\nSee our Manual of Style, Policy and our Template Help page\n\nJoin the Discord community!\n\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCookies Settings\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nDC Database is a FANDOM Comics Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"

See also DC Universe, DCU, DCAU.\n\nThe DC Extended Universe[1] (official designation Earth-1)[8] is a reality within the Post-Crisis Arrowverse.[9] At least two divergent realities have branched off from it, and some events in its canon are shared with the DC Universe.[10]\n\nIt is the setting of several live-action films adapting DC Comics stories, beginning in 2013 with Man of Steel and ending in 2023 with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. It also includes comic books, novels, and video games.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tEarly history\n1.2\t20th century\n1.3\t21st century\n1.3.1\tInflux of superheroes\n1.3.2\tMultiversal incursions\n1.4\tPotential future\n2\tPoints of Interest\n3\tResidents\n4\tMedia\n4.1\tFilms\n4.2\tTelevision series\n4.3\tAncillary material\n5\tNotes\n5.1\tCanceled media\n6\tSee Also\n7\tLinks and References\n7.1\tReferences\nHistory\nEarly history\n\nThis universe is designated Earth-1 in Arrowverse multiverse,[8] replacing the previous Earth-1 in the wake of the Anti-Monitor crisis.[11] Various advanced races from many worlds reside here, but its Earth's technology and connection to other planets and alien races is rather primitive compared to some other universes.\n\nEarth's forces face down Darkseid's invasion\n\nIn the early years of human civilization, powerful wizards gifted some humans such as Black Adam magical abilities and making them \"champions of magic\",[12] while other races related closely to humanity, such as the Olympians, Amazons, and Atlanteans, existed separate from them, using their natural enhanced abilities to build their own civilizations. They came together once to face the invading intergalactic tyrant Darkseid, and after that became separate once more for thousands of years.[13]\n\n20th century\n\nThe Justice Society, the 20th century's greatest heroes\n\nThe first superhero of this world seems to be the Amazon Wonder Woman, who emerged in 1917 during World War I,[14] and operated primarily in secret throughout the 20th century.[15] Other superheroes, such as Hawkman, Doctor Fate and Atom Smasher, formed the Justice Society to battle evil as a team years later.[16]\n\nWhile some heroes, such as the second Blue Beetle, were celebrated by many,[17] the emergence of the vigilante Batman in Gotham City around 1995 brought some controversy to the idea of superheroes, though it was mostly kept quiet as the Batman dispelled crime around the city.[18]\n\n21st century\nInflux of superheroes\n\nIn 2013, the powerful extraterrestrial Kryptonians became public knowledge to humanity at large, with Superman's first public appearance and battle with General Zod, and changed the public perception of superheroes and made them much more important to human culture.[19] Controversy around both superpowered individuals and human vigilantes quickly rose, culminating in genius sociopath Lex Luthor unleashing Doomsday in 2015, and forcing Superman to sacrifice his life for Earth's survival.[18]\n\nThe Justice League\n\nSoon after this, many metahumans were inspired to become costumed heroes themselves, leading to the formation of teams like the U.S. government-sanctioned Task Force X,[20] and later the Justice League, the Batman's superhero strike team who resurrected Superman and stopped the invasion of Steppenwolf. Included on this team were Wonder Woman and the Aquaman, both representing the Amazons and the Atlanteans respectively to the wider world, and bringing Earth's sentient races slightly closer together again.[13]\n\nIn the wake of the Justice League's formation, the founder of Task Force X, Amanda Waller, launched a campaign to control superheroes beyond the program, operating the covert Project Butterfly mission,[21] reforming the Justice Society under her jurisdiction,[22] and even acquiring contacts to Superman and the Justice League. Eventually, Waller's daughter exposed the Task Force X program to the public, presumably shutting it down.[23]\n\nMultiversal incursions\n\nFlash of two worlds\n\nAs early as 2019, Earth-1 began to experience interdimensional incursions, with the speedster known as the Flash meeting his Earth-Prime counterpart during the Anti-Monitor crisis,[11] Wonder Woman meeting a counterpart of Serena Williams who had her powers and used the moniker Wonderous Serena,[11][24] and a hero from Earth-9, Beast Boy, traveling across the multiverse using the Red, briefly flying past this world and several others.[25]\n\nThe divergent reality\n\nIn 2022, the Flash used his connection to the Speed Force to travel back in time and save his mother from death. His alterations created a divergent reality in which General Zod's invasion was more successful, Batman was older and had retired, and Superman had been killed as an infant.\n\nWhen his attempts to use time travel to protect this world from Zod resulted in the multiverse destabilizing, the Flash was forced to go back in time once more to stop himself from changing anything at all. However, this only sent him into a second divergent reality much closer to his own, but still very different in some ways.[26] He currently resides in this alternate universe[27]\n\nPotential future\n\nThe nightmarish future of this universe, as glimpsed in a vision by Victor Stone\n\nIn a future first glimpsed by the Batman in 2015, Darkseid found his way back to Earth and found the Anti-Life Equation, which he used to make Superman his slave. While the Justice League fought against them, they were no match for their combined power and were defeated easily as Darkseid conquered and ravaged Earth, transforming it into a primordial, apocalyptic wasteland.[13]\n\nThe Batman formed a resistance of surviving heroes and villains to battle Darkseid and Superman, but they were not enough, and the Flash eventually traveled back through time to warn the League of the past how to stop the threat.[18] Despite his efforts, visions of this future were seen by the Batman and Victor Stone two years after the Flash had arrived in the past, so it appears it has not been averted.[13]\n\n\n\nPoints of Interest\nApokolips[13]\nButterflies' home planet[23] (Destroyed)\nEarth[19]\nAtlantis[28][13][29]\nCorto Maltese[30]\nKahndaq[22]\nThemyscira[14][13]\nUnited Kingdom[14][13]\nUnited States of America[19][18]\nBelle Reve Correctional Center, Louisiana[20][30]\nCentral City[26]\nEvergreen, Washington[21]\nGotham City[18]\nGCPD Headquarters[13]\nWayne Aerospace Hanger[13]\nWayne Manor[18]\nMetropolis[19][18]\nDaily Planet[19]\nS.T.A.R.

While they share many similarities, The Flash confirms Snyder's version to be canon to the DCEU, referencing the time travel sequence exclusive to its events.[26]\nWhen originally announced, the TV series Krypton was going to be set in the DCEU, but it was later decided to set it within its own universe.[36]\nEvery project in the DCEU from Suicide Squad to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was produced by DC Films.\nCanceled media\nThe films Joker and The Batman were originally meant to be set in the DCEU, but due to shifting creative teams and other matters, they became standalone movies.\nThe film Batgirl was meant to be released in 2022 as a part of the DCEU, but a few months before release, the project was permanently shelved for a tax write-off, despite being in post-production at the time. The film was shot from November, 2021 to March, 2022. After entering post-production, the film was cancelled by Warner Bros. Discovery in August 2022. It was reported that WBD felt the film \"simply did not work\" and went against the new desire and mandate from CEO David Zaslav to make DC films \"big theatrical event films\". The film was directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, and starred Leslie Grace as Batgirl, J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon, Brendan Fraser as Ted Carson/Firefly, Michael Keaton as Batman, Ivory Aquino as Alysia Yeoh, and Jacob Scipio as Anthony Bressi.[37] It was also reported that writing off the film as a tax break was the most \"financially sound\" option for WBD.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\nCharacters from DC Extended Universe\nOther things related to DC Extended Universe\nDC Extended Universe's Comic Appearances\nReality Gallery: DC Extended Universe\n\n\n\n\nLinks and References\nDC Extended Universe Wiki\n\nReferences\n↑ \nJump up to:\n1.0 1.1 1.2 Batman V Superman Empire Cover Revealed; Zack Snyder on the DCEU – ScreenRant\n↑ What Should The DCEU Be Called Now? – ScreenRant\n↑ The DC Extended Universe Labelled 'Worlds of DC' At Comic-Con – ScreenRant\n↑ Entertainment Geekly: Your thoughts on the DC Cinematic Universe – Entertainment Weekly\n↑ Will Warner Brothers & DC Ever Catch Up To Marvel Television After Last Night's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.? – Forbes\n↑ DC's Zack Snyder-Verse Just Received The Final Nail In Its Coffin, Making The Justice League's Return Nearly Impossible – ScreenRant\n↑ Brace Yourself: The SnyderVerse Might Not Be Buried After All – Fortress of Solitude\n↑ \nJump up to:\n8.0 8.1 Serving Up Justice #3\n↑ DC's Legends of Tomorrow: \"Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five\"\n↑ \nJump up to:\n10.0 10.1 James Gunn on Creature Commandos and Killing Nazis in His New DC Universe – YouTube\n↑ \nJump up to:\n11.0 11.1 11.2 Arrow: \"Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four\"\n↑ \nJump up to:\n12.0 12.1 Shazam!

A decade later, Waggoner portrayed both Steve Trevor and his son, Steve Trevor Jr, on Wonder Woman, whose developer for television, Stanley Ralph Ross, had written several Batman installments and indeed had appeared in \"The Penguin's Nest/The Bird's Last Jest\" as \"paper-hanger\" (professional forger) Barney \"Ball-Point\" Baxter, though with no lines.\n\nUnlike the earlier movie serials of the 1940s, this was the first Batman project to feature Batman's rogues gallery of villains. Cesar Romero made numerous appearances as the Joker, while Burgess Meredith reinvented the image of the Penguin, with his crooked smile and trademark \"squawk.\" Julie Newmar provided Catwoman's rolling \"R's,\" but she was unavailable for the 1966 movie Batman and was replaced by Lee Meriwether. The part was recast a third time for season three when Newmar was committed workwise, with Eartha Kitt taking the role. Two men provided their talents to the role of the Riddler — Frank Gorshin for seasons one and three; and John Astin for one critically panned story in season two, when Gorshin pulled out due to salary disputes.\n\nBy season three, declining ratings prompted the introduction of a third partner to the Batman Family, Barbara Gordon – aka Batgirl (played by Yvonne Craig). (As stated above, Alfred Pennyworth learned her secret dual identity, even though neither Bruce/Batman nor Dick/Robin did.) The pattern of the series also changed, being cut down from two episodes a week to one. The cliffhanger endings were also eliminated, as it was felt these would be difficult to remember from week to week. Stand-alone episodes were therefore introduced, with next week's villain being introduced at the end of a story.\n\nAlthough Batgirl was an immensely popular character, her presence could not save the series, and it was canceled by ABC in 1968. Two weeks after the cancellation, NBC offered to make a fourth season, providing the sets — the Batcave, Wayne Manor and Gotham City Police Headquarters — were still available. However, NBC's offer came a week too late, as the sets had already been demolished.\n\nMusic\n\nThe iconic theme song for the series was created by composer Neal Hefti. The show's incidental music was composed by Nelson Riddle and Billy May.\n\nTrivia\nFor the first two seasons, Batman episodes were aired as two-part storylines, with the title of the second episode often rhyming with the title of the first episode.\nBatman was famous for showcasing various celebrity talents including: Edward G. Robinson, Jerry Lewis, Art Linkletter, Roddy McDowall, Milton Berle, Dick Clark, Steve Allen, Sammy Davis Jr., and many others.\nThe Batman and Batgirl costumes from this series are featured in the Kingdom Come future era Planet Krypton restaurant in Kingdom Come #1 and the \"One Year Later\" epilogue following Kingdom Come #4 in the collected editions. The Batman costume is seen hanging in a display case, while a T-shirt salesgirl reading a Young Love comicbook wears the Batgirl costume.\nIn the Arrowverse crossover, Crisis on Infinite Earths, it is revealed that, in the Arrowverse Multiverse, this continuity is set on Earth-66.\nThe Earth designation obviously comes from 1966 which is when the show first aired.\nDespite making various cameos in the DC Rebirth era, it is only revealed during the Dark Crisis event that, in the Post-Flashpoint Multiverse, this continuity is set on Earth 66.[1]\nExternal links\nBatman (TV Series)\nCollapse\nBatman in Other Media\n\n\nFilms\tBatman (serial) • Batman and Robin (serial) • Batman (1966 film) • Batman (1989 film) • Batman Returns • Mask of the Phantasm • Batman Forever • Batman & Robin • SubZero • Return of the Joker • Mystery of the Batwoman • Batman Begins • The Batman vs. Dracula • Gotham Knight • The Dark Knight • Public Enemies • Under the Red Hood • Apocalypse • Year One • Justice League: Doom • The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 • The Dark Knight Rises • The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 • Lego Batman: The Movie • Son of Batman • Assault on Arkham • Batman vs. Robin • Animal Instincts • Monster Mayhem • Dawn of Justice • Bad Blood • The Killing Joke • Mechs vs. Mutants • Return of the Caped Crusaders • The Lego Batman Movie • Batman and Harley Quinn • Batman vs. Two-Face • Justice League • Scooby-Doo! & Batman • Gotham by Gaslight • Batman Ninja • Batman vs. TMNT • Hush • Family Matters • Soul of the Dragon • Zack Snyder's Justice League • The Long Halloween • The Batman • The Doom That Came to Gotham • Merry Little Batman • Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League • The Batman – Part II\nTelevision\tBatman • The Batman/Superman Hour • Super Friends • The New Adventures of Batman • The Animated Series • The New Batman Adventures • Batman Beyond • Justice League • Justice League Unlimited • The Batman • The Brave and the Bold • Beware the Batman • Gotham • Batwheels • Gotham Knights • Caped Crusader\nVideo games\tBatman (ZX Spectrum) • The Caped Crusader • Batman: The Video Game (NES, Genesis, Game Boy) • Batman: Return of the Joker • Batman Returns (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) • The Animated Series • The Adventures of Batman & Robin (SNES, Sega) • Batman Forever (Arcade, home console) • Batman & Robin • Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker • Chaos in Gotham • Gotham City Racer • Vengeance • Dark Tomorrow • Rise of Sin Tsu • Batman Begins • Lego Batman: The Videogame • Arkham Asylum • The Brave and the Bold • Arkham City • Arkham City Lockdown • Lego Batman 2 • The Dark Knight Rises • Injustice • Arkham Origins • Arkham Origins Blackgate • Beyond Gotham • Arkham Knight • Arkham Underworld • Batman: The Telltale Series • Arkham VR • Injustice 2 • The Enemy Within • Gotham Knights\nAudio\tStacked Cards • Robin Meets Man-Bat • The Lazarus Syndrome • Knightfall • The Audio Adventures • Batman Unburied • The Riddler: Secrets in the Dark • High Volume\n↑ Dark Crisis: Big Bang #1\nCategories\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Horror Sci-fi DC\nRecent Images\nSergeant Harp (Fables)\n2 hours ago\nTeth-Adam (Prime Earth)/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nAmazons of Paradise Island/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nDeals on \nFanatical is a Fandom brand.\nThe following products are sponsored.\nLEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham\n-80%\n$19.99\n$3.99\nScribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure\n-88%\n$2.49\nInjustice 2\n-92%\n$4.12\nInjustice: Gods Among Us - Ultimate Edition\n-88%\n$2.49\nLEGO DC Super-Villains\n-88%\n$4.99\nSuicide Squad: Kill The Justice League\n-92%\n$5.77\nNew releases\n\nCheck out the new comics, collections and more this week.\n\nWant to help out?\n\nWrite an issue synopsis\n\nWrite a character bio\n\nCatalog character appearances\n\nSee our Manual of Style, Policy and our Template Help page\n\nJoin the Discord community!\n\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCookies Settings\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nDC Database is a FANDOM Comics Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"

It officially first appeared in 2024 with the series premiere of Creature Commandos, though some earlier events in its canon are shared with the DC Extended Universe.[2]\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tEarly history\n1.2\t20th century\n1.3\t21st century\n1.3.1\tSuperhero influx\n1.3.2\tU.S. Task Force programs\n1.4\tAverted future\n2\tPoints of Interest\n3\tResidents\n4\tMedia\n4.1\tFilms\n4.2\tTelevision series\n4.3\tAncillary material\n5\tNotes\n6\tSee Also\n7\tLinks and References\n7.1\tReferences\nHistory\nEarly history\n\nIn this universe, Earth has been dominated by humans for thousands of years, while non-human civilizations on their world, such as the Amazons on Themyscira[3] or the Atlanteans underwater,[4] went unknown by the general public for years. At some point, superpowered metahumans began to emerge, and their existence became common knowledge to the rest of humanity by the 18th century.[5] By the early 19th century, humans began making incredible scientific advancements, as seen when Dr. Victor Frankenstein brought to life his patchwork zombies, Eric and the Bride.[6]\n\n20th century\n\nG.I. Robot with Easy Company in World War II\n\nIn 1943, deep into World War II, a complex combat android dubbed G.I. Robot was manufactured by the U.S. government to kill Nazi soldiers, and served with the army platoon Easy Company until the end of the war. Around 1965, G.I. Robot was studied by Dr. William Magnus, who used the data he collected to make further advancements in robotics.[7]\n\nMany morally righteous metahumans began to don masks and costumes, and began to use their abilities to protect others as superheroes, which led to the rise of amoral metahumans using their abilities for evil as supervillains.[5] By the end of the Cold War, extraterrestrial life was discovered by American astronauts in the form of Starro. Seeing the potential to weaponize its mind-controlling spores, the U.S. government captured the creature in the 1980s and began experimenting on it for years.[8]\n\n21st century\nSuperhero influx\n\nSuperheroes became a major part of life on Earth by the 21st century, with some like the Batman in Gotham City and the second Blue Beetle in Palmera City becoming famous and well-liked figures.[9][10] Two such heroes, the Amazon warrior Wonder Woman and the Atlantean hero Aquaman, brought public attention to Themyscira and Atlantis, though some still considered their civilizations myths.[3][4]\n\nSuperman protecting the people of Metropolis\n\nAs the number of superheroes and supervillains increased, the tech company LordTech sponsored their own superhero team to protect the city of Metropolis. Sometime after this, the Kryptonian hero Superman emerged, with greater powers than any other known metahumans.[11][12] His powers themselves eventually became a source of controversy across the world, with many seeing him as an American asset with no real limitations on authority.[5]\n\nU.S. Task Force programs\n\nThe Task Force X team assigned the Project Starfish mission\n\nThe U.S. government eventually formed A.R.G.U.S. to deal with metahumans, magic, and other supernormal threats.[3] Their director, Amanda Waller, founded the Task Force X program, through which incarcerated supervillains would perform covert ops government missions in exchange for shortened sentences. This program ran in secret for years, running the Project Starfish and Project Butterfly missions,[8][4] until Waller's daughter exposed it to the press in 2022 and it was promptly shut down by Congress.[13][3]\n\nIn 2023, Waller managed to circumvent Congress's restrictions against using human prisoners as mission operatives by selecting entirely non-human individuals for her new Task Force M program, which she used to carry out a mission to protect Princess Ilana Rostovic from the witch Circe in Pokolistan,[3] and later to assassinate her.[14]\n\nAverted future\n\nA vision of a war-torn future, which has since been erased\n\nIn a now-averted future foreseen by Circe, Princess Ilana would form an alliance with Gorilla Grodd and use her country's militia to wage a vicious and bloody war against the rest of the world. The war would result in the deaths of dozens of Earth's superheroes and the princess conquering the planet.[14] This future was erased when the Bride assassinated Ilana in 2023.[15]\n\n\n\nPoints of Interest\nButterflies' home planet[13] (Destroyed)\nEarth[8][4]\nArctic Circle[12]\nFortress of Solitude[12]\nBoravia[12]\nCorto Maltese[8]\nValle del Mar[8]\nJotunheim[8] (Destroyed)\nJarhanpur[12]\nPokolistan[3]\nFrankenstein Manor[16][3] (Destroyed)\nPoko Castle[16][3]\nUnited States of America[8][3]\nBelle Reve Correctional Center, Louisiana[8][3]\nEvergreen, Washington[4]\nGotham City[17]\nMetropolis[3][12]\nDaily Planet Building[11][12]\nLuthorCorp Tower[11][12]\nS.T.A.R.

Originally set on \"Earth-1\", the Arrowverse was expanded into an infinite multiverse— within the Divine Continuum— that houses the settings of most of the live-action and animated adaptations of DC Comics stories and characters.\n\nIn the wake of the Anti-Monitor Crisis, which featured the destruction and rebirth of the Multiverse, the Arrowverse was rebooted: the original realities were merged into a single continuity, the DC Extended Universe became the new Earth-1, and the rest of DC continuities were likewise restored within the reborn Multiverse.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tEarly History\n1.2\tCrisis on Earth-X\n1.3\tElseworlds\n1.4\tAnti-Monitor Crisis\n1.5\tRebirth of the Multiverse\n1.6\tForces War\n1.7\tMagog's Masterplan\n1.8\tBloodwork Crisis\n1.9\tFlashpoint Crisis\n2\tStructure of the Multiverse\n2.1\tList of Universes\n3\tBarryverse\n4\tResidents\n5\tNotes\n6\tTrivia\n7\tSee Also\n8\tLinks and References\n8.1\tReferences\nHistory\nEarly History\n\nMar Novu at the dawn of time\n\nThe Maltusian scientists, Mar Novu and his wife Xneen, sought to see the creation of their universe so they experimented on time travel, building a time machine which Mar Novu used to go back at the Dawn of Time. There, he was overwhelmed by the radiations of the Temporal Zone and obtained cosmic powers which made him the Monitor; he then fell through the space itself to the Antimatter Universe where it was somehow born his negative doppleganger, Mobius, later called the Anti-Monitor.\n\nThe Anti-Monitor was sealed by his positive counterpart into his home dimension but he swore to Novu to take his revenge against him and the Multiverse itself: the seal separated the positive realms from the doorstep of Mobius' prison whose door was placed on Earth-1 in what would become Central City in modern days. It was also prophetised that he eventually would free himself and destroy the Multiverse which could only be saved by seven righteous individuals, collectively known as the Paragons.\n\nIn ancient times, free will was spread on Earth-1 as the Greek Goddess, Clotho, destroyed the Loom of Fate and its pieces were scattered across many realities in the Multiverse. During the age of Gods and heroes, supernatural creatures also lived on the earthly realms, along with the Divine beings.\n\nDue to his evil actions, the time demon, Mallus, was banished into another plane of existence by the Totems of Zambesi users; along with him, a great number of creatures, including Clotho and the Fairy Goodmother, were sealed into this dimension.\n\nAt some point in time, there was an incursion on Earth-19 by an unknown universe that led to the creation of the Collector Agency which had to ensure the respect of a ban on interdimensional travel on this reality; in fact, those who disrespect it are punished by the Collectors with the death penalty.[3]\n\nDuring his career as a superhero, the Crimson Comet, Jay Garrick aka Flash of Earth-3, explored many realities in the Multiverse, collecting informations about his discoveries.[4]\n\nThe singularity\n\nIn 2015, an immense worm hole originated on Earth-1, causing the creation of space portals between Earth-1 and Earth-2. The evil speedster Zoom took advantage of the situation to satisfy his hunger for speed by challenging Barry Allen aka The Flash after having already defeated Jay Garrick on Earth-3.\n\nAlmost one year later, Zoom tried to destroy all the realities in the Multiverse through the use of the Magnetar, a complex machine which had to be powered by Speed Force energy: he challenged Barry Allen one last time to determine who was faster between them while gathering enough energy to start his doomsday device. During their run, Barry Allen was able to create a time remnant that stopped the Magnetar at the cost of his life while Barry's real self managed to defeat the evil speedster who was dragged into the Speed Force to become its enforcer, the Black Flash.[5]\n\nCrisis on Earth-X\n\nEarth-X Nazis' attack Barry Allen and Iris West's wedding\n\nIn 2017, the Nazis of Earth-X, a cruel universe where the German Party won World War II and conquered the Earth, targeted Supergirl and the heroes of Earth-1, assembling a giant army to invade their universes.\n\nThey managed to track them to the wedding of Barry Allen and Iris West which was crashed by a plotoon of Nazis which confronted the heroes that were present at the church. The Nazi troupes were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat, losing one of their commanders, Tommy Merlyn aka Prometheus.\n\nThe main army was led by a new Führer, Oliver Queen, also known as Dark Arrow, and they were also helped by a displaced Earth-1 Reverse Flash: their main goal was to use a light accelerator, the Prism, to artificially create red sunlight that would help them transplant Supergirl's heart to her Earth-X counterpart, Overgirl, who also was Oliver's wife, as she was dying from sunlight overloading.[6].\n\nThe Freedom Fighters\n\nSome of Earth-1's heroes were abducted to Earth-X so Oliver Queen and others had to travel to the obscure reality where they found help in the Freedom Fighters, a resistance team which was led by Captain Winn Schott and the Ray from Earth-1.[7] After joining their forces, they saved the abducted group and discovered Earth-Xers' doomsday device, the Wellenreiter, a militarized timeship that was to be deployed on Earth-1.[8]\n\nWhen the Nazi finally attacked Central City on Earth-1, all the heroes fought against the Nazi enemies and defeated them: Overgirl ultimately died from her disease and Dark Arrow was killed by Earth-1 Oliver Queen; after they lost their leader and the Wellenreiter was destroyed by Harry Wells, the Nazis were forced to concede defeat and retreat to their universe.[9].\n\nElseworlds\n\nMonitor destroying Earth-90\n\nAt some point in 21st century, the Monitor began his journey through the Multiverse in search for potential heroes that could help him prevent an incoming Crisis. He tested some universes, entrusting some of their residents with the Book of Destiny; then, he arrived on Earth-90 which failed to prove itself worthy to be saved so it was destroyed as the Flash became its only survivor and escaped into another universe.[10].\n\nIn December 2018, he came to Earth-1 where he passed the Book of Destiny to John Deegan in order to challenge the heroes of this world. The scientist used the Book of Destiny to create a new reality in which the identities of the Green Arrow and The Flash were swapped so the two heroes found themselves in each other's bodies.[11]\n\nSuperman teamed up with his cousin and the heroes of Earth-1 to fight Amazo\n\nThanks to Iris West, the two heroes were able to reach Earth-38 where they asked the help of Supergirl and his cousin, Superman. After returning to altered reality, the Earth-1 heroes were forced to face the threat of the android A.M.A.Z.O. who could replicate any power he scanned: as the heroes banded together and combined their different abilities, they were able to destroy the evil robot.[11]\n\nLater, thanks to Vibe, the heroes tracked Deegan to Gotham City where they retrieved the Book but they had to stop a riot in Arkham Asylum with the help of the vigilante Batwoman. In the meantime, the Flash of Earth-90 also came to Earth-1 and warned them about the Monitor's intentions. The heroes confronted the Cosmic God which got his Book back and ordered Deegan to \"think bigger\", altering the reality for the second time and causing the Flash of Earth-1 and Green Arrow to become the infamous Trigger Twins.[12]\n\nInspired by Clark Kent, Deegan turned himself a black-suited doppleganger of Superman and imprisoned Supergirl in the S.T.A.R. Labs's pipeline. However, the Trigger Twins convinced the alternate Cisco to take them to Earth-38 where they told Superman about Deegan's menace; at the same time, on the Elseworlds, the alternate Alex Danvers freed Supergirl and, while Deegan was facing Superman, the heroes used the Book of Destiny to restore Flash, Green Arrow and Supergirl's identities.[13]\n\nThen, Superman/Deegan retrieved once again the Book of Destiny and planned to change the unvierse again: the Flash and Supergirl tried to slow him down by running at super-speed around the Earth. As the two were nearly torn apart, Oliver Queen made a deal with the Monitor to save them in exchange for being his enforcer in the incoming Crisis.[13]\n\nDeegan and his army, including a resurrected A.M.A.Z.O., were defeated by the group of superheroes and the scientist became an husk after his connection with the Book of Destiny was interrupted as it was hit by a Monitor-powered arrow of Oliver Queen. The reality was restored to his original form and Deegan was imprisoned in Arkham Asylum where he befriended an inmate, Roger Hayden who warned him that \"worlds will live, worlds will die, and the universe will never be the same\".\"[13]\n\nAnti-Monitor Crisis\n\nEarth-2 is destroyed by Antimatter\n\nIn May 2019, after the defeat of the Ninth Circle, the Monitor called Oliver Queen to his duties, sending him into various missions in order to prepare him for the future Crisis. Not long after Oliver's recruiting, Lyla Michaels also became Monitor's enforcer as the super-powered Harbinger.\n\nMeanwhile, after finding the Flash of Earth-90 in the Antimatter Universe, the Anti-Monitor, who in the course of millennia had planned to destroy every Earth in the Multiverse with the antimatter, forced the speedster to run in order to power up its antimatter cannon that obliterated Earth-2 as a test.[14]\n\nBefore the annihilation of Earth-2, Jinn Pierce's subconscious used her abilities to upload her mind to an alternate plane of existence in order to save itself from death.[15]\n\nAfter traveling to Earth-3, Barry Allen managed to project his mind into the future with the help of Jay Garrick and his wife, Joan Williams, seeing the outcome of the incoming Crisis.[4]\n\nShadow Demons\n\nOn December 10, 2019, in order to prove the Monitor's non-existence, the adventurer Nash Wells found the Nexus' door and freed the Anti-Monitor from his prison: this marked the beginning of the Crisis. Mobius began its destruction, letting his cannon fire an antimatter wave into the Multiverse which began erasing one reality after the other while the Anti-Monitor himself was rampaging through the realities, being heralded by his shadow demons.[16]\n\nEvacuation of Earth-38\n\nAs Earth-38 was about to be destroyed by the wave, the most righteous heroes were gatherered so they could band together to save this reality's residents while the Monitor raised colossal tuning forks which were rapidly assaulted by the Anti-Monitor's dark forces: in the climax of the battle, Oliver Queen bravely died to save more people he could.[17] As the wave erased this world, the heroes retreated back on Earth-1, which was the last reality in the trajectory of the wave, and used the Waverider of Earth-74 as their moving base.[18]\n\nThe heroes failed to rescue many realities, including Earth-N52, Earth-F and Earth-76, while Nash Wells, now reborn as Pariah, was forced to watch the reality he previously doomed dying. As the Anti-Monitor unleashed Nash Wells' antimatter counterpart, Outkast, the heroes fought him on Earth-D and brought him on the Waverider after defeating him. However, Outkast tried to detonate himself but the heroes managed to save themselves.[17]\n\nMeanwhile, the Book of Destiny revealed to the Monitor about the existence of the Paragons who could save the Multiverse from annihilation. Thanks to the help of the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardian Ganthet of Earth-12 that let Felicity Smoak read the Book of Oa, Sara Lance and Kara Zor-El were discovered to be Paragons.[16]\n\nMeanwhile, the Council of Luthors battled the Council of Supermen on Earth-99 but was ultimately defeated by the Supermen of the Multiverse after a tough battle. Lex Luthor of Earth-38 was inspired by this all-out war so he escaped his imprisonment on the Waverider and stole the Book of Destiny to kill the remaining Supermen, including the Superman of Earth-75, through the Multiverse: he was stopped by the joined forces of his archenemy Kal-El and the Superman of Earth-96 who was discovered to be the Paragon of Truth.[16]\n\nConstantine, Diggle and Mia meets Lucifer on Earth-666\n\nJohn Constantine, Mia Smoak and Sara Lance resurrected Oliver Queen in a Lazarus Pit on Earth-18 but they discovered that he lacked his soul;[18] later, Constantine and Mia, along with John Diggle, came to Earth-666 to meet the Devil himself, Lucifer Morningstar, who gifted them a special card to enter the Purgatory where they retrieved Oliver's soul but they also found the Avatar of the Spectre, Jim Corrigan that convinced the Emerald Archer to prepare himself to become the Entity's new host.[19]\n\nAfter Ray Palmer built a Paragon detector, Batwoman was discovered to be the Paragon of Courage who she had previously searched for on Earth-99; later, Barry Allen, Martian Manhunter and the Earth-1 professor Ryan Choi were identified as the remaining Paragons.\n\nAs the antimatter was approaching to her universe, Jennifer Pierce was also brought to her safe place where she found Jinn Pierce and their Earth-1 doppelganger, Gen Pierce. However, after Jennifer's doppelgangers finished telling her their stories, reality caught up with them and they were both erased from existence.[15]\n\nMeanwhile, Vibe's powers were restored by the Monitor so the heroes to manage to enter the Nexus' chamber and stop Barry Allen of Earth-90 from powering the antimatter cannon. The machine went critical,[19] forcing Pariah to rescue Black Lightning' from the destruction of his world[15] as his powers were needed to contain the energy of the cannon while, in order to ultimately destroy it, Earth-1 Barry Allen decided to sacrifice himself as it was always prophesized to him since he had first become the Scarlet Speedster.[19]\n\nEarth-90 Barry sacrifices himself\n\nBefore he could jump on the machine, the older Flash tricked Barry into taking his place, reminding him that the prophecy never said which Flash had to die: as he remembered one of the first meeting with his beloved wife,[20], Barry vanished in thin air after one last run and fulfilled his lifetime as a hero by saving the rest of the Multiverse.[19]\n\nBarry meets the Flash\n\nBelieving to have finally stopped the end of everything, the heroes were shocked by a brainwashed Harbinger who killed the Monitor and allowed the Anti-Monitor to resume the destruction of the Multiverse which was annihilated along with the few survivors on the Waverider.\n\nHowever, the Paragons were hidden by Pariah at the last minute in Vanishing Point, a place out of space and time, to survive the total annihilation. There, they discovered that Lex Luthor had previously replaced Earth-96 Superman as the Paragon of Truth thanks to the Book of Destiny's reality-altering power.[19]\n\nBattle at the Dawn of Time\n\nAfter spending a month out of time, the newly-born Spectre, Oliver Queen, reached the Paragons in Vanishing Point. Despite Oliver's warnings, The Flash convinced him to power him up enough to run into the slowly dying Speed Force where he met another version of himself that made him realize that the Multiverse could be brought back to existence; at the same time, Supergirl and other Paragons were sent back in time to stop Mar Novu from ever creating the Anti-Monitor but, while managing to stop him from going back at the Dawn of Time, the superheroes discovered that Mobius was always meant to come into existence. The Paragons reunited with the Spectre at the Dawn of Time where Good and Evil faced each other in an epic battle.[21]\n\nAs Barry and Sara stood by Oliver's side as, after winning his clash with Mobius, he ultimately died from his wounds, the Paragons gathered his Spectre's energy and used it, along with their own energies and the remains of the Book of Destiny, to recreate reality itself.[21]\n\nRebirth of the Multiverse\n\nEarth-Prime is born\n\nA new Big Bang was caused by the combination of Oliver Queen/Spectre and the Paragons' energies; the original singularity divided itself once again and recreated the infinite realities. Every reality was restored to the existence so all the residents in the Multiverse were brought back to life.\n\nEarth-1 did not seperately exist anymore as it was merged into a new universe, Earth-Prime, along with Earth-38 and Black Lightning's world: their histories were amalgamated as if all their residents had always lived together in a single world.\n\nWaking up in a new universe, the Paragons discovered the merge of their realities and, after discovering the Anti-Monitor's survival, they banded together with the other Earth's heroes one last time to finally defeat him and his demons. Upon realizing that Mobius was too strong even for their combined powers, Earth-Prime's heroes used Ray Palmer and Ryan Choi's knowledge to banish the Dark God, who had become a giant version of himself, into the Microverse.[22]\n\nThe new Earth-2\n\nIn the new Multiverse, some realities were recreated with some differences from the original ones, like Earth-2, while others were totally anew, like the Earth-Prime which replaced Earth-1 as the new center of the Multiverse. However, after the Crisis, these universes are not separated anymore by vibrational frequencies so it is currently impossible to move from a reality (at least from Earth-Prime) to another one which led the Earth-Prime heroes to believe that the Multiverse was gone.\n\nAt some point in time in the new Multiverse, the Flash of the reborn Earth-2 banished the time-traveling supervillain Per Degaton to an alternate timeline.[23]\n\nDuring the Crisis, various residents of the Pre-Crisis realities managed to save themselves from the annihilation by felling through the space itself to the newly-born Earth-Prime;[24][25] later, it was also revealed that two or more counterparts cannot exist on the same Earth (at least on Earth-Prime) for a large amount of time without dying.[26] For unknown reasons, the minds of all the Harrison Wells' dopplegangers of the Pre-Crisis Multiverse, including the Eobard Thawne's, were merged into Nash Wells'.[27]\n\nAs a consequence of being corrupted by the Spectre's mystical energy during the Crisis, the Speed Force was fatally destabilized and ultimately destroyed, causing every speedster to gradually run out of power.[28] Eventually, Team Flash built a machine to artificially engineer Speed Force energy, like Thawne did with the Negative Speed Force, powering it up with the multiversal energies of the Harrison Wells inside of Nash Wells, who sacrificed himself to create the Artificial Speed Force[29]: he was corrupted by the energies of the new force and forced to shut down the extra-dimensional field.[30]\n\nBecause of Nash Wells' sacrifice, the Multiverse tried to balance itself for the loss of the various doppelgängers by restoring the Earth-Prime counterpart of Wells as a multiversal pure-energy being who could travel trough time itself.[30][31] Some time in early 21st Century, refuges from Earth-29 escaped from their dying world to another reality. A few decades later, the villainous Brutus sent an interdimensional Bounty-Hunter to search for one of these refuges.[32]\n\nForces War\n\nThe new Forces of Nature\n\nBarry eventually used Iris West's last remnants of the Speed Force to power up the machine once again in order to revive the original Speed Force. However, along with it, they created new elemental Forces, including the Sage Force, the Still Force and the Strength Force whose conduits began fighting against each other for their own survival.[31] After trying to undo their creation by time traveling in the past,[33] the Flash, along with Iris West-Allen, managed to convince the Speed Force to stop the all-out war between the Forces which began coexisting together.[34]\n\nMagog's Masterplan\nThis article is a stub.

In this timeline, metahumans don't exist and Supergirl survived the death of Krypton instead of her cousin Kal-El. Eventually, this reality was erased after Barry ran again back in time and prevented his past self from saving his mother.[35]\n\nExpand\n\n\nThis section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information, expanding on the subject matter in order to bring this article to a higher standard of quality.\n\n\nThis template will categorize articles that include it into Category:Incomplete Articles.\nStructure of the Multiverse\n\nThe Multiverse\n\nIn the beginning, there was only a single, black singularity; it then broke so the Big Bang created the Multiverse, every existence multiplied by possibility[17] with Earth-1 as its original center.\n\nEvery reality in the multiverse vibrate at its own frequency that separates one world from the other and they also feature counterparts to other worlds' characters, like Jay Garrick of Earth-3 and Barry Allen of Earth-90. People with special abilities are also known as metahumans: in particular, they exist the so-called vibers who are directly linked to the energies of the Multiverse so they have the power to move into other planes of existence and realities, like Cisco Ramon/Vibe or the Collector Agency's members of Earth-19.\n\nThe concept of time of this Multiverse is embodied by the so-called Temporal Zone, the vortex of time itself where all the events from across the ages and realities exist at the same time. It is commonly used by non-speedsters to move through time and it was supposed to be preserved by the Time Masters who, however, began controlling it from the Vanishing Point, outside of time and space, until their defeat.[36]\n\nThe Speed Force is another extra-dimensional source of power that gifts to whoever taps into its energy the ability to move at superhuman speed; it is connected to both the Multiverse and the Timestream as it allows the speedsters to move through the infinite realities and to travel back and forward in time. Eventually, in a possible future, the scientist, Eobard Thawne, was able to replicate the Speed Force in order to create his own artificial source of energy, the Negative Speed Force, which made him able to travel through time without any rules which caused him to be immune to reality-altering events and permanent death.\n\nAt some point in time, they were created two metaphysical books, the Book of Destiny and the Book of Oa. The Book of Destiny has the ability to manipulate the Multiverse's energy to alter the reality itself, rewriting events or, even, entire universes; the Book of Oa, which is stored on Earth-12, contains all the knowledge in the Multiverse from all the events that were, are and will be in the future.\n\nOther higher beings, like the Spectres or the Phantom Stranger, are in tune with the Multiverse and observe events from across the realities.\n\nList of Universes\n\nThe Arrowverse Multiverse has both similarities and differences with the ones from the comics and it is composed of infinite universes with, at least, 1938 known realities in the original multiverse, and, at least, 4125 in the reborn multiverse.[37]\n\nMap of the Multiverse by the time of the Crisis\n\nSome of the original Pre-Crisis realities were mapped out by the Jay Garrick, the Flash of the Pre-Crisis Earth-3/Post-Crisis Earth-2.[4]\n\nExpand\nList of realities\n\n\nThe Multiverse also includes various extradimensional planes and spiritual realms, most of which are common to multiple realities, and pocket universes inside the main realities:\n\nExpand\nList of extradimensional planes\n\n\nIn the scope of a larger multiverse, they also exist an infinite number of alternate timelines and possible futures. Theoretically, everyone's choices lead to the creation of parallel worlds where things could be different.[122]. Alternate timelines can also be born as a result of alteration of certain events by using time travel or reality-warping powers, like Mister Mxyzptlk's, or objects such as the Spear of Destiny or the Loom of Fate. Time is not strictly fixed so there could also be infinite possible futures which not necessarily could ever come to exist.\n\nExpand\nList of alternate timelines and possible futures\n\n\n\n\nBarryverse\n\nThe Barryverse, which is named after the author Barry Lyga,[154] is the setting of the The Flash and Supergirl novels, beginning with The Flash: Hocus Pocus. It is a \"local\" Multiverse within the larger Multiverse[155] that was born because Flashpoint never occurred.\n\nIn this \"local\" Multiverse, in fact, Iris West managed to prevent Barry Allen from running back in time and creating the Flashpoint Timeline. However, this event caused the birth of a separate reality, where many events from the TV series never occurred or were totally different.[156] It was later revealed that the realities around Earth-1A were also affected by Barry's actions[155] that had caused to the creation of divergent versions of the Pre-Crisis Multiverse realities.[157]\n\nAfter meeting the alternate Cisco thanks to his powers, the main Cisco Ramon began referring to the alternate universe as \"Earth-1A\" to avoid confusion between the two universes. Out-of-universe, the author Barry Lyga has also referred to every alternate reality in the Barryverse with \"-A\" suffix in their names.\n\nLike the main Multiverse, this Multiverse has faced its own Crisis that led to the birth of a single continuity. The events of this Crisis take place at the same time of the Anti-Monitor's Crisis in the main Multiverse.[155]\n\nExpand\nList of Barryverse realities and timelines\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents\nToo many to list\nNotes\nThe events of the Titans episode, \"Dude, Where's My Gar\" reveal that, except for the Arrowverse shows which were merged into a single continuity, the DC live-action/animated series and movies, including the ones whose Pre-Crisis continuities were shown in the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover, only take place in the Post-Crisis Multiverse.\nWhile the original Arrowverse continuity debuted in Arrow #0, the earliest reality belonging to this Multiverse first appeared in the 1941 Superman cartoon, Superman.\nTrivia\nAccording to Marc Guggenheim, Krypton and Gotham (and its prequel Pennyworth) are meant to be part of the Arrowverse Multiverse.[83] However, for some reason, they were not included in the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover.\nCameron Cuffe, the main star of Krypton, almost joined the crossover as a Kryptonian elder of Argo City but his cameo was ultimately cut due to scheduling conflicts.[161]\nAlthough it was not shown being part of the Arrowverse Multiverse onscreen, the TV series Powerless was stated to be set on Earth-P.[69]\nHowever, Van Wayne Industries was shown to exist on Earth-Prime in the Post-Crisis multiverse.[70] This cameo was an idea of DC's VP of Creative Affair and Creative Services, Dan Evans and was meant to suggest that some of Powerless'' continuity was now part of Earth-Prime.[162]\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\nCharacters from

It stars Grant Gustin as the title character, and centers around his heroic activities with his team, and their battles to protect their world from supervillains.\n\nNine seasons of the show were produced and aired on The CW between 2014 and 2023. Early seasons were well-received, but many came to criticize the sloppy writing and restrictive budget of its later seasons. It began as a direct spin-off of Arrow, and was part of several crossovers with other Arrowverse series.\n\nContents\n1\tCast\n1.1\tStarring\n1.2\tRecurring\n2\tEpisodes\n2.1\tSeason 1\n2.2\tSeason 2\n2.3\tSeason 3\n2.4\tSeason 4\n2.5\tSeason 5\n2.6\tSeason 6\n2.7\tSeason 7\n2.8\tSeason 8\n2.9\tSeason 9\n3\tExternal links\nCast\nStarring\nGrant Gustin as Barry Allen / Flash and Savitar\nCandice Patton as Iris West\nDanielle Panabaker as Dr. Caitlin Snow / Frost / Khione and Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost\nCarlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon / Vibe\nTom Cavanagh as Prof. Eobard Thawne / Dr. Harrison Wells / Reverse-Flash, Harry Wells, H.R.

Premiering on HBO Max in 2022, it stars John Cena as the eponymous vigilante, who performs missions for the U.S. government as part of a covert ops team of misfits.\n\nThe series was met with positive reviews for its writing, action and Cena's performance, and saw increasing viewership with each episode of its first season. The first season is set in the DC Extended Universe, while the second season integrates the series into the DC Universe franchise.[note 1]\n\nPeacemaker is a spin-off of The Suicide Squad (2021), and itself led to the spin-off series Creature Commandos (2024–present).\n\nContents\n1\tPlot synopsis\n2\tCast\n2.1\tStarring\n2.2\tRecurring\n3\tEpisodes\n3.1\tSeason 1\n4\tProduction\n4.1\tDevelopment\n4.2\tProduction on Season 1\n4.3\tProduction on Season 2\n4.4\tMusic\n5\tCompanion podcast\n6\tNotes\n7\tExternal links\n8\tReferences\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.\nPlot synopsis\n\nAfter recovering from injuries sustained on a mission with the Suicide Squad in Corto Maltese,[1] the extremist vigilante Peacemaker joins a new covert ops team with agents Leota Adebayo, Emilia Harcourt and John Economos, who are accompanied by Peacemaker's wannabe best friend, Vigilante. As the team goes on world-saving missions, they grow closer together and Peacemaker begins to question his ethos and moral code, especially as he is forced to face his past.[2]\n\nCast\nStarring\nJohn Cena as Chris Smith/Peacemaker[3]\nDanielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo[4]\nFreddie Stroma as Adrian Chase/Vigilante[5]\nJennifer Holland as Agent Emilia Harcourt[4]\nSteve Agee as John Economos[4]\nRobert Patrick as Auggie Smith/White Dragon[6]\nChukwudi Iwuji as Clemson Murn (season 1)\nFrank Grillo as Gen.

However, he was eventually offered the chance to create the series by Warner Bros, and produced the series with his production company, Troll Court Entertainment, and The Safran Company, in association with Warner Bros.[11][12]\n\nProduction on Season 1\n\nThe first season was filmed from January to July of 2021,[13] with Gunn directing five episodes and the other three being directed by Jody Hill, Rosemary Rodriguez, and Brad Anderson. It was released in early 2022 on HBO Max,[14] and following increasing viewership and positive reviews, Peacemaker was renewed for a second season the day before its first season finale premiered.[15]\n\nProduction on Season 2\n\nProduction on Season 2 was delayed when Gunn became the head of DC Studios in October 2022, but it was eventually filmed in 2024. Gunn directed three episodes of the series while also directing Superman.[16] Season 2 is set to premiere in August 2025.\n\nMusic\n\nThe series is scored by Clint Mansell and Kevin Kiner,[17] and features several glam metal songs selected by Gunn himself. The first season's opening title sequence is an extravagant dance number performed by the cast, set to \"Do You Wanna Taste It\" by Wig Wam.[18] There will be a new dance number for the second season's title sequence, according to Frank Grillo.[19]\n\nCompanion podcast\n\nPodly: The Peacemaker Podcast is a companion podcast that released weekly alongside the first season, hosted by Ify Nwadiwe and Fiona Nova and featuring interviews with the cast and crew.[20]\n\nNotes\nPeacemaker Presents: The Vigilante/Eagly Double Feature! is meant to bridge the gap between Season 1 and Season 2 of Peacemaker, with Gunn serving as story consultant, though it is not strictly DCU canon.[21][22]\nThe series draws inspiration from several comics, most prominently Peacemaker (Volume 2), Peacemaker (Volume 1), and Suicide Squad (Volume 1). In turn, the comic miniseries Peacemaker Tries Hard! was inspired by the TV show.\nExternal links\nPeacemaker at the DC Extended Universe Wiki\nPeacemaker at the DC Universe Wiki\nPeacemaker (TV series) at Wikipedia.org\nPeacemaker season 1 at Wikipedia.org\nPeacemaker season 2 at Wikipedia.org\nReferences\n↑ The Suicide Squad (2021)\n↑ Peacemaker Official Trailer – YouTube\n↑ @JohnCena on X\n↑ \nJump up to:\n4.0 4.1 4.2 @CultureCrave on X\n↑ James Gunn Confirms a Major Peacemaker Hero Will Return Before Season 2 – CBR\n↑ @jamesgunn on Instagram (June 13, 2024)\n↑ @jamesgunn on Instagram (May 10, 2024)\n↑ The onscreen Eagly is entirely a digital effect animated by Wētā FX, while Baker provides his vocalizations\n↑ Elizabeth Faith Ludlow on Instagram (October 3, 2024)\n↑ @DCFilmNews on X\n↑ The Suicide Squad Spinoff Peacemaker Begins Filming With James Gunn – ComicBook.com\n↑ Danielle Brooks, Robert Patrick, Jennifer Holland and Chris Conrad to Star in HBO Max Original Series Peacemaker, from James Gunn and Peter Safran – WarnerBros.com (archived)\n↑ @JamesGunn on X (archived)\n↑ The Batman Trailer, Looks At The Flash, Aquaman 2 Hit DC FanDome – The Hollywood Reporter\n↑ Peacemaker Season 2 Is Official Says James Gunn & John Cena – Deadline\n↑ Peacemaker Season 2 Starts Filming & James Gunn Shares Photo From The Set – Deadline\n↑ @JamesGunn on X (June 14, 2021) (archived)\n↑ Peacemaker Premiere: James Gunn Talks Opening Credits Dance Party – Rolling Stone\n↑ \"We Do Get Into It\": Frank Grillo Teases His Fight With John Cena In Peacemaker Season 2 – Collider\n↑ Peacemaker Podcast From Rooster Teeth to Feature James Gunn, Others – Variety\n↑ DC To Prepare Peacemaker Fans For Season 2 With New Eagly/Vigilante Double Feature Comic Series – ScreenRant\n↑ @JamesGunn on X (archived on Reddit)\n↑ According to this IGN interview with James Gunn, the entirety of Peacemaker's first season is DCU canon, save for the appearance of the Justice League in the finale, which will be explained in the upcoming second season\nCategories\nLanguages\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Horror Sci-fi DC\nADVERTISEMENT\nRecent Images\nSergeant Harp (Fables)\n2 hours ago\nTeth-Adam (Prime Earth)/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nAmazons of Paradise Island/Gallery\n3 hours ago\nADVERTISEMENT\nNew releases\n\nCheck out the new comics, collections and more this week.\n\nWant to help out?\n\nWrite an issue synopsis\n\nWrite a character bio\n\nCatalog character appearances\n\nSee our Manual of Style, Policy and our Template Help page\n\nJoin the Discord community!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nCookies Settings\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\nDC Database is a FANDOM Comics Community.\nVIEW MOBILE SITE\nSearch this wiki\nSearch all wikis"

However, where there should have been one universe, there were many, each one a replication of the first, with their own separate histories.\n\nAt the present time, a great white wall of pure antimatter energy stretches out across the cosmos. It pervades the Multiverse, consuming entire galaxies. On an unknown parallel world, a being named Pariah arrives. He is forced to witness the death of multiple worlds in multiple dimensions. He disappears as he is transported to the parallel world known as Earth-Three. On that world, the Crime Syndicate, in a rare demonstration of heroism, strives to save their beleaguered planet. However, even their combined might cannot prevent their deaths at the antimatter wall.\n\nThe planet's sole hero, Alexander Luthor, retreats to his home where his wife, Lois, holds their infant son, Alexander Jr., in her arms. Luthor places his son into an experimental rocket capsule and launches him from the planet Earth. As Earth-Three dies, Alexander's capsule pierces the vibrational wall separating dimensions. It lands on the abandoned Justice League Satellite orbiting Earth-One.\n\nOn board another satellite, a being called the Monitor summons his assistant Lyla (also known as Harbinger). He instructs her to travel to various alternate Earths and bring together a select group of super-powered beings. Harbinger uses her power to create replicant versions of herself and sends them to the various Earths. The Monitor, meanwhile, prepares to gather Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s space capsule.\n\nThe first of Harbinger's replicants travels to Earth-One and gathers King Solivar from Gorilla City. Another travels to Earth of the 30th century and summons Dawnstar of the Legion of Super-Heroes to her cause. A third replicant journeys to Earth-Two of the year 1942 to enlist the aid of Firebrand. One version gathers the Blue Beetle from the Chicago of Earth-Four. Another version of Harbinger collects the Psycho-Pirate from Earth-Two's present timeline. She brings him to Earth-One, where they encounter Firestorm and Killer Frost. The Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to make Killer Frost fall in love with Firestorm. Another replicant travels to Pre-Cataclysmic Atlantis to find Arion the Sorcerer. However, a Shadow Demon attacks her and takes possession of Harbinger. The possessed replicant finds Arion and brings him back to the Monitor's satellite.\n\nWhen they arrive, they find a room full of heroes and villains from alternate realities. Before the assemblage has a chance to acclimate itself to their foreign environment, a horde of Shadow Demons attacks them. They fight them off until the Monitor arrives. He casts a brilliant burst of light, which dispels the shadows. Introducing himself, he tells the impatient gathering that the Multiverse may soon be destroyed.\n\nTime and Time Again!\nThe Dawn of Man\n\nAnthro the Cave-Boy leads a herd of mammoths away from the village of the Bear Clan tribe. After falling from atop one of the great beasts, he peers through the underbrush where he sees an image of a great futuristic city. He shakes his head and when he looks again, the image is gone. In addition, the herd of mammoths that he had corralled is likewise missing.\n\n30th Century Earth\n\nMembers of the Legion of Super-Heroes discover the displaced mammoths stampeding through Plaza Square in Metropolis. Colossal Boy attempts to scoop them up into his giant arms, but they suddenly disappear.\n\nEarth One\n\nIn Gotham City, the Joker murders film mogul Harold J. Standish. Batman crashes through the window and attempts to disarm the villain, but the Joker keeps him at bay with an adhesive-shooting flower. Suddenly, a distraught image of the Flash appears before them, warning about the end of the world. Batman tries to talk to the Flash, but he disintegrates before his eyes.\n\nOn board the Monitor's satellite, the Monitor warns his assemblage that a wave of antimatter energy is sweeping through the Multiverse, consuming entire realities. He has established certain devices throughout the various realities designed to halt the antimatter wall. He requires the heroes to travel to each reality and activate each of the devices. Nobody truly trusts the Monitor, but they realize that they have little choice but to heed his warnings.\n\nSuperman of Earth-Two, King Solovar and Dawnstar travel to Earth-AD, the world of Kamandi. They find the adventurer, Kamandi, scaling the side of an immense golden tower. The heroes realize that this is of the devices that the Monitor spoke of. A horde of Shadow Demons arrives to sabotage the tower, but the heroes manage to drive them away.\n\nArion, Obsidian and the Psycho-Pirate arrive in ancient Atlantis. Suddenly, Pariah arrives, but quickly falls sway to the Psycho-Pirate's emotion manipulation. Arion turns his power against the Psycho-Pirate and frees Pariah of his influence. Psycho-Pirate suddenly disappears and rematerializes in a darkened room. A deep voice bellows forth to him, commanding him to follow his every order. Psycho-Pirate, terrified by this mysterious individual, meekly complies.\n\nMeanwhile, back on the Monitor's satellite, the Monitor asks Harbinger to retrieve Alexander Luthor from his nursery. Harbinger is shocked to discover that Alex, formerly an infant, is now the age of a young child. Suddenly, the dark influence of the Shadow Demon takes control of her, commanding her to betray the Monitor.\n\nOblivion Upon Us\n\nHarbinger walks into the Monitor's sanctum as he continues testing young Alexander Luthor. Luthor is aging at an accelerated rate, and is now the physical age of an adolescent boy. The Monitor discovers he is composed of both positive matter and antimatter, and believes that this composite life form may hold the key towards stopping the Crisis. Harbinger, still under the influence of a dark, mysterious entity, leaves the Monitor's satellite and reports to her new master.\n\nOn Earth-One in the 30th century, the Flash races through the streets desperately attempting to halt a series of natural disasters. He sees a wave of pure antimatter spreading outwards in the distance. He vibrates his molecules at super-speed, sending himself backwards through time.\n\nIn the 20th century, the antimatter wave has reached Earth-One and it slowly begins to dissolve everything in its path. The Teen Titans team up with the Outsiders to save as many citizens of New York as possible. Batman and Superman arrive as well to lend a hand. Suddenly, Batman sees the Flash appear before his eyes. However, before the Flash can respond, he screams in pain and terror as he is pulled into another dimension and disappears.\n\nIn outer space, Brainiac's brain-ship surveys the progress of the antimatter wave. He logically deduces that in order to preserve his own life, he must help to save the Multiverse. Brainiac flies off to find his old partner, Lex Luthor.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Beetle, Doctor Polaris and Geo-Force arrive in Markovia in the spring of 1944. Markovia is currently under Nazi occupation and the Nazis attempt to secure the Monitor's energy tower. The American military forces known as Easy Company, the Losers and the Haunted Tank are present as well. While the heroes engage the Nazis, they must also contend with a horde of Shadow Demons. The Shadow Demons succeed in killing several war-time soldiers, including Easy Company's Flower and the Losers; Johnny Cloud, Captain Storm, Gunner, and Sarge. On Earth-AD, Superman-Two, Dawnstar, Solovar and Kamandi stand by helplessly as they watch the sky turn the color of blood and lightning storms erupt all around them. Solovar, finally succumbing to his recent injuries, dies in Kamandi's arms.\n\nMeanwhile, Cyborg, Green Lantern, Psimon and Firebrand materialize in the town of Coyote, Texas in the year 1879. They meet up with several Southwestern heroes including Nighthawk, Scalphunter, Bat Lash, Johnny Thunder and Jonah Hex. The two disparate groups join forces and locate another one of the Monitor's towers.\n\nHowever, the destructive wave of antimatter that the Monitor warned of strikes the Earth at all time periods simultaneously. While the other heroes fight against more Shadow Demons, Nighthawk is consumed by the antimatter wave.\n\nAcross time in the 30th century, the Legion of Super-Heroes shares a similar tragedy. While saving innocent civilians in England, Kid Psycho falls prey to the white energy wall.\n\nBack on the Monitor's satellite, Harbinger returns. Consumed by the influence of her new master, she releases a blast of energy at the Monitor.\n\nAnd Thus Shall the World Die\n\nAs Supergirl joins a despondent Batgirl on top of a city building on Earth-One, trying to encourage her before she is called to rescue a plane that falls apart approaching the antimatter wave, Pariah arrives on Earth-Six where he confronts the royal superhero family of Lord Volt, Lady Quark, and Princess Fern as the antimatter wave destroys their world as well. Lady Quark watches helplessly as both her husband and daughter are consumed in the wave while Pariah transports her safely out of the universe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Monitor prepares to create a new hero to help him in his quest. By firing an ion-based energy ray into an unstable star in the Vegan system in the Earth-One universe, he causes a powerful flare of solar energy to travel to Earth. It reaches the observatory of Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi, who berates her staff as she uses the telescope to observe the destructive phenomenon present. She screams as the flare strikes her and then mysteriously transports her out of the lab, leaving her fellow workers and her father wondering what happened to her.\n\nIn the dark place where the Psycho-Pirate is taken prisoner, the shadowy figure watches on the screen the Red Tornado in action and uses his power to teleport him to the same place.\n\nOn Earth-Two in the time of Camelot, Firestorm and Killer Frost (still under the love thrall of Psycho-Pirate) get help from the Shining Knight to protect the cosmic tuning fork planted there in that time period, as Vandal Savage watches from a window. The three heroes engage the Shadow Demons in battle, but it is all for naught as they merge and form a giant Shadow Demon. This also happens in the other time periods that the cosmic tuning forks and the Shadow Demons appear.\n\nIn the present time of Earth-One in Metropolis, the superheroes see yet another cosmic tuning fork appear, though this time with a female in a costume similar to that of Dr. Light. She tries to warn the heroes approaching her to stay away from the tower, and blasts them away with a burst of light. Katana, who understands Japanese, realizes that this Dr. Light is not their enemy, but an ally. Superman, who is able to converse in Japanese, tells Dr. Light that he knows the situation they are in and they only want to help.\n\nWhile on board the satellite, the Monitor watches the heroes valiantly but vainly try to protect the cosmic tuning forks, as Pariah emerges to find that the Monitor was expecting him. He reveals to Pariah that he was responsible for his survival when he should have died for his deeds, but before he could say anything more, Harbinger appears, obviously not in control of herself. She strikes the Monitor with a powerful blast that sends him hurtling down platforms until he finally lands dead. Pariah mourns as he realizes that with the death of the Monitor came the death of all hope.\n\nAt that moment, the heroes of both Earths One and Two can only watch as their worlds, consumed by antimatter, fade into nothingness.\n\nWorlds in Limbo\n\nIn the Antimatter Universe, a dark, malevolent force addresses his new playthings, Psycho-Pirate, the Flash and Red Tornado. He has Psycho-Pirate use his emotion-controlling abilities to keep the Flash in line, while also promising that he will soon have his own worlds to rule.\n\nOn the Monitor's satellite, Harbinger regains control of her mind, and realizes what she has just done—she has just killed the Monitor. Pariah is present, and tries to get answers from her, but Harbinger has no memory of the attack. Suddenly, a view screen activates and a pre-recorded image of the Monitor addresses both of them. He tells them that he knew of his eventual demise at Harbinger's hands, and bears her no ill will. To safeguard the remaining universes, he turned his body into an energy conduit. Upon his death, the Monitor's life essence shunted Earth-One and Earth-Two into a Netherworld, keeping them safe from his adversary's attack—at least for now. However, in his haste to save them, all time has become one. Alexander Luthor enters the chamber and hears the last of the Monitor's speech.\n\nOn Earth-One, varying timelines begins to intermingle with one another. Dinosaurs and World War I era bi-planes exist side by side with modern day Metropolis skyscrapers, and strange vessels from the far-flung future. Amazingly, Earth's populace remains relatively calm—another side-effect of the Monitor's influence.\n\nBack on the Monitor's satellite, Alex, Pariah and Harbinger summon together a massive congregation of heroes from Earth-One and Earth-Two. They explain the present situation, but also explain that in order for things to correct themselves, the Multiverse must be folded back upon itself and become a single universe once again, or else all worlds will be destroyed.\n\nOn Earth-One, other heroes continue to help out amidst the confusion. Batman invites a group of heroes and villains into the Batcave for consultation. Starfire and the Legionnaire Sun Boy fly to Russia to help Red Star tackle a dinosaur. Members of the Green Lantern Corps fly to Oa to seek aid from the Guardians of the Universe, but the Guardians are swept up in an unforeseen attack. Rip Hunter and the Time Masters try to solve the mystery of the inter-connecting timelines. Wildcat saves a little girl from crumbling debris, but his legs are crushed in the process.\n\nMeanwhile in the Antimatter Universe, the unseen enemy takes control of the Red Tornado and reconstructs him to do his bidding. He turns him into a force of primal energy and sets him upon the Earth. As the Red Tornado storms across the country, Earth-One and Earth-Two begin to slowly merge together. People see ghost-like astral images of people from the parallel worlds.\n\nThe Flash overcomes Psycho-Pirate's control and demands to see the face of the being who abducted him. The enemy steps forward and introduces himself as the Monitor. This Monitor however, is not the same as the one who just died. Unlike the more human-looking Monitor, this one is a gruesome mechanical-looking alien with blazing red eyes and jaundiced yellow skin.\n\n3 Earths! 3 Deaths!\n\nThe new Monitor gloats that the other Monitor is dead, and now he has only his enemy's remaining energies to absorb as well as those of three remaining positive-matter universes, and the heroes on board his satellite headquarters to destroy, before ultimate power can be his. As the Flash slowly recovers, the new Monitor grants Psycho-Pirate his wish for a world to control. He makes the Psycho-Pirate see three Earths, each of them belonging to the three positive-matter universes, and causes the villain's emotion-controlling powers to increase to an incredible scale, affecting all three Earths.\n\nOn board the earlier Monitor's satellite, the heroes try to rescue each other as it is now being ripped apart. Pariah screams as he finds himself being transported elsewhere. Alexander Luthor Jr. tries to use his powers to save the heroes on board, but Harbinger stops him from doing so and instead flies into the energy chamber where their main non-powered self is located. Just as Harbinger merges back into her original form, the satellite explodes.\n\nBack on Earth-Two, Al Pratt takes the injured Ted Grant to his apartment to rest, trying to comfort his friend as he now feels useless in the battle. Outside his apartment, Yolanda Montez watches from a window, silently promising that Wildcat will still carry on. On Earth-One, Lex Luthor is transported from being in a cyclone via a teleportation beam to Brainiac's skull skip, where he sees his old partner in his new form, ready to conquer the universe.\n\nSome of the heroes on board the satellite find themselves on Earth-X, which they see is now being devoured by the antimatter wave, but they also see within the wave the appearance of Harbinger, attempting to do something. They soon spot people heading toward the antimatter wave like lemmings. Northwind flies down to stop them, but he is attacked by Uncle Sam's Freedom Fighters. The new Dr. Light uses her light powers to create a blinding barrier to keep the people from reaching the wave, but the Ray attacks her, causing her to fall into the arms of the Earth-Two Hawkman.\n\nSome other heroes were transported to Earth-Four, where they see the antimatter wave devouring the Earth in the middle of a rainstorm. Azrael spots the Blue Beetle's Bug hovering overhead and tries to investigate it, but is blasted away by Captain Atom. Nightshade and Peacekeeper join the fray on the ground, along with Judo Master who assaults Katana, mistaking her for \"Nazi filth\". Jay Garrick prevents Thunderbolt from speeding his way into a death run with the antimatter wave. The Question is with Blue Beetle in his Bug, wondering why they are compelled to head toward the wave.\n\nBack on Earth-One, Aquaman along with Aqualad and Aquagirl discover that the underwater cities of Tritonis and Poseidonis have mysteriously disappeared. As they swim off, Black Manta and the Ocean Master watch until they also disappear. Dolphin notices this as she swims behind them.\n\nThe final group of heroes from the Monitor's satellite appear on Earth-S, where Changeling as an elephant is hurled through a brick building by Captain Marvel. Supergirl tries to reason with him as she fights him, but Captain Marvel only answers her with his fists. Kole erects a crystal barrier to prevent people from entering the antimatter wave, while Wonder Woman vainly struggles with Mary Marvel wrapped in her magic lasso, resisting the Amazon's efforts. Black Canary stuns both Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. with her sonic \"canary cry\". Wonder Woman is left looking at the image of Harbinger in the antimatter wave, wondering what she's doing.\n\nSoon, the cosmos shudders as the three remaining positive-matter universes are now transported into the Netherverse through Harbinger's power, and Psycho-Pirate realizes that he is losing control over the people's emotions. Now drained of her power, Harbinger reverts back to being Lyla and joins Alexander Luthor Jr. on an asteroid overlooking the five universes slowly merging with each other, and now in danger of annihilating each other.\n\nBack on Earth-Two, Alan Scott, Power Girl, and Johnny Quick chase after Star Sapphire, Per Degaton, and Deathbolt when the three villains suddenly vanish, leaving the heroes wondering where they went. Back at the apartment building of Ted Grant, as he is resting in his bed, Yolanda Montez now makes her debut in costume as the new Wildcat.\n\nBeyond the Silent Night\n\nWith a group of heroes selected from the five surviving universes and transported there with the help of Pariah, Lyla reveals to them the origin of the universes they're trying to protect: Krona, a scientist on the world of Oa, performed a forbidden experiment of looking in time to the creation of the universe, which had dangerous repercussions. It created not only an evil antimatter duplicate of the known universe, it also created endless positive-matter duplicates of the universe, with Oa being the only planet not duplicated except in the antimatter universe, where it was called Qward, the home of the Thunderers. Krona was banished from his world, and since then the Oans attempted to atone for his misdeed through the creation of both the Manhunters and the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nOn the moons of both Oa and Qward, two similar but opposed beings emerged and came to life; they both became the Monitors. The Monitor of the positive-matter universe simply sought knowledge about his universe, while the Monitor of the other universe sought control over it, creating an army of warriors called the Thunderers and changing some into Shadow Demons. The two Monitors became aware of each other and waged war with each other until a simultaneous attack rendered them both unconscious until the present time.\n\nPariah joins the story with how he got involved: as the leading scientific mind on Earth of his universe, using his skills to turn his world into a paradise, he now sought to examine the origin of the universe, despite concerns from his people that he could end up destroying their universe in his pursuit for knowledge. Not taking heed to the concerns, Pariah set up a chamber in his lab where he could enter a pocket of the antimatter universe to observe the creation of the universe. As he did, his entrance set off a chain reaction, creating an antimatter wave that destroyed his universe, leaving Pariah stranded in space, safe but now realizing his error. However, with the destruction of his universe, the Monitor of the Antimatter Universe awakened, absorbing the power from the destruction. It also awakened the Monitor of the positive-matter universe, who now sought Pariah to use him for the purpose of saving it.\n\nWith a shifting of selected heroes, they are prepared to take on the being they now call the Anti-Monitor. Alexander Luthor Jr. used his powers to open a portal between the two universes, with the assorted heroes flying through this portal, to arrive on the other side, following Pariah's sensing abilities as he directed them to a glowing asteroid which was the Anti-Monitor's fortress. Inside, he watches the heroes approach and calls Psycho-Pirate to him, commanding him to use his powers against them. When Psycho-Pirate reveals that his emotion-controlling powers need to be recharged, Anti-Monitor angrily swats him away and decides to deal with them himself.\n\nThe death of the Earth-One Supergirl\n\nSoon the heroes find themselves battling the fortress itself as it comes to life with statues attacking them, reassembling themselves as they get damaged. Some of the heroes realize that some of their own powers don't work as they would normally in the Antimatter Universe. Nonetheless, Superman of Earth-One and Dr. Light manage to reach the heart of the fortress, where they see a machine converting starlight into energy, that is responsible for the merging of the universes. Superman of Earth-One plans to destroy it, but is suddenly attacked by the Anti-Monitor by a powerful blast. His scream attracts the attention of his cousin Supergirl, who engages the Anti-Monitor in physical combat, destroying his armor and also destroying the universe-merging machine. Dr. Light sees that Supergirl is seriously wounded from her battle and tries to get her out, but Supergirl tells Dr. Light to get her cousin out of there. This distraction enables the weakened Anti-Monitor to hit Supergirl with a titanic blast of energy, killing her in the sight of her cousin Kal-El.\n\nAs Anti-Monitor enters into an escape ship to recuperate, Superman of Earth-One holds his cousin Kara in his arms as she passes away, screaming that he would get his revenge. Superman of Earth-Two comforts his Earth-One counterpart and gets him to follow the heroes back to their own universe as the Anti-Monitor's fortress falls apart. Back on Earth-One, the heroes gather for a memorial service with Batgirl as the main speaker, stating, \"Kara is a hero. She will not be forgotten.\" Later on, near the Fortress of Solitude, Superman of Earth-One has Kara's body wrapped up in her cape and flies her to New Krypton where she will be buried.\n\nA Flash of the Lightning\n\nThe Flash is captured, bound to a wall in a space capsule heading for the planet Qward in the Antimatter Universe. Psycho-Pirate is present, but fearful for his life. He wonders if the Anti-Monitor perished during his battle with Supergirl. Suddenly, the Anti-Monitor appears before them wearing new battle armor. He tells the Psycho-Pirate that he will spare him—for now.\n\nOn Apokolips, DeSaad watches the space capsule and asks his master Darkseid what they're going to do. Darkseid answers that they're simply going to watch and see what happens. If the heroes prevail against the Anti-Monitor, Darkseid says, then the \"status quo\" will be maintained. If the Anti-Monitor prevails, then he will be weakened enough to the point where Apokolips' sole leader will destroy him.\n\nIn the 30th century, the Legion of Super-Heroes monitor the partially merged five Earths. Brainiac 5 throws himself into his research, refusing to come to terms with Supergirl's death. Saturn Girl observes that his mind is in turmoil.\n\nIn the 20th century, Firestorm communicates with Vixen who finds famed robotics expert Professor T.O. Morrow. They bring Morrow to the remains of the Justice League satellite where they hope he can effect repairs upon the robot that he invented—Red Tornado. Ray Palmer is also present, and is inspecting the Tornado's body from the inside. Suddenly, something deep within the Tornado's bio-system activates and a huge explosion tears through the satellite. Blue Devil, one of the heroes summoned to examine Red Tornado's inner workings, finds himself transported to the Vegan system to deal with the Omega Men.\n\nBack on Qward, the Anti-Monitor supervises the construction of an Antimatter cannon. With this weapon, he intends on finishing off the remaining Earths. Dozens of Qward's Thunderers work as slaves to complete the weapon. The Flash meanwhile, manages to break free. He grabs the Psycho-Pirate and races off with him across the barren landscape. Moving at super-speed, he exposes the Psycho-Pirate's face to many Thunderers. He forces Psycho-Pirate to warp their emotions into feelings of hatred for the Anti-Monitor. One by one, the Thunderers turn against their master, but the Anti-Monitor easily defeats them. While the villain is distracted, the Flash finds the Antimatter energy core that powers the cannon. Running faster than he has ever run in his life, he circles around the energy core thousands of times, turning the unstable antimatter back upon itself, destroying the cannon. The influx of energy is too much for the Flash's mortal body however. He begins phasing through different points in the time stream, and before long, he loses all physical cohesion and dies. All that is left of him is his empty costume and his ring. His noble sacrifice has saved billions of lives across the Multiverse.\n\nFrom beyond the walls of time and space, one being screams out in unbridled anger. The Spectre has awakened.\n\nWar Zone\n\nOn Oa, the Guardians of the Universe make a last-ditch effort to combat the hysteria that is gripping the universe. They recruit Guy Gardner back into the Green Lantern Corps and give him a ring again.\n\nSuddenly, a cosmic crimson flame from beyond the void washes over Oa. The Green Lantern Citadel is destroyed and all but one of the six remaining Guardians are killed. Guy Gardner swears vengeance.\n\nMeanwhile, a cadre of Earth's most powerful super-villains gathers together aboard Brainiac's starship with T.O. Morrow now joining them. Lex Luthor coordinates the meeting, declaring that they shall take advantage of the Crisis by holding three of the multiple Earths hostage. Alexei Luthor of Earth-Two protests, citing that he should lead the cadre rather than his Earth-One counterpart. Brainiac concedes that there is no need for two Lex Luthors, destroying the Earth-Two Luthor.\n\nReporters have dubbed the point where the five remaining Earths intersect one another as the Warp Zone. Within this area, a strange time-distortion effect has allowed for creatures and entities from various timelines to interact with one another. Dinosaurs are seen stomping through the same New York City streets as World War I era biplanes and futuristic starships. Firehawk flies with Wonder Girl into the Warp Zone, trying to find Donna Troy's husband.\n\nAt the United Nations, representatives from the various parallel dimensions address the assembly. Key speakers include Pariah, Harbinger and Alexander Luthor. The nation leaders are concerned that the spreading chaos may result in an inter-Earth war. During the address, a holographic image of Lex Luthor appears before them and extends an ultimatum. Citing that he already controls three of the five Earths, he demands the unconditional surrender of the remaining two, or else he and Brainiac will unleash a destructive force that will obliterate all five.\n\nWhile the other heroes struggle to pierce the barrier separating the merging Earths, Jay Garrick recruits Kid Flash to help him. They rebuild Barry Allen's cosmic treadmill and use their combined speed to pierce the barrier with an assembly of heroes standing on connecting platforms, ready to do battle.\n\nMeanwhile, Luthor's cadre of villains takes advantage of the situation. They spread themselves across the realities, sowing chaos and discord at every turn. Chemo poisons the waters surrounding Hudson Bay, killing Aquagirl. Doctor Phosphorus brutally injures Hawkman. The Joker and Poison Ivy capture the Freedom Fighters. Eclipso incapacitates Wonder Woman, and the Justice League fight the Brotherhood of Evil.\n\nBack on Brainiac's ship, Luthor and Brainiac continue to coordinate their plans. Should the governments of the combined Earths fail to meet their demands, Luthor is more than ready to destroy all five planets. Suddenly, Psimon appears from behind the shadows. He is the only super-villain that did not join with the others planet-side. Using his powerful mental energy, Psimon blasts Brainiac, shattering him into a thousand pieces. He then brings himself to bear upon Lex Luthor.\n\nDeath at the Dawn of Time\n\nAfter destroying Brainiac's shell, Psimon turns his attention towards Lex Luthor. He plans on taking over the united villains after killing Luthor. What Psimon doesn't realize however is that Brainiac's consciousness has been downloaded into the circuitry of his ship. He forges a new body for himself and blasts the top off of Psimon's crown with a beam of energy.\n\nOn Earth-One at the dawn of mankind, Anthro continues to see wild streaks of red lightning flashing across the sky. He ponders whether he should tell the rest of the tribe, but fears that they may find him crazy.\n\nOn Earth-Four, Chemo stands next to the ruins of the Statue of Liberty. All about him, the waters surrounding Manhattan Island are bubbling with deadly poisonous fumes. Negative Woman flies about him, ensnaring the gigantic villain with bands of shadow energy. The bands constrict until they eventually succeed in destroying Chemo's artificial shell. In Manhattan, Black Adam fights against Robotman and Dove. Kole of the New Teen Titans flies up behind him and turns his body into solid crystal. Robotman is prepared to shatter him, but Dove holds him back. Meanwhile, Cyborg and Celsius tackle Quakemaster.\n\nMeanwhile, Aqualad races back to Atlantis, carrying Aquagirl's body. He hands her over to the city's medical specialists, but there is nothing they can do. Aquagirl has died.\n\nIn the frozen wastelands of Earth-S, Doctor Sivana, Doctor Cyber, Per Degaton, Houngan, Phobia, Despero, Deathbolt, Hector Hammond and Professor T.O. Morrow keep watch over the captured members of the Marvel Family. While Sivana is in the midst of gloating, the Martian Manhunter burrows through the ice and attacks them. He blasts at Deathbolt with his Martian vision. The Atom and Platinum of the Metal Men arrive to give him back-up. Phobia tries to use her powers on Platinum, but they fail since she is a robot, enabling the Atom enough time to loose the gag around Billy Batson's mouth. Billy shouts the magic word \"Shazam!\" and transforms into Captain Marvel.\n\nOn Earth-X, Batman and the original Atom fight up against the Calendar Man while the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. take on the Dummy. Hawkwoman and Tin fight Lightning Lord, and Firestorm and Vixen fight up against Captain Cold and the Icicle. The Green Arrow of Earth-Two assists Changeling and Mento in combating the Shaggy Man. The Green Arrow defeats the Shaggy Man with an explosive-tipped arrow.\n\nSuddenly, the Spectre makes his presence known across the five partially merged Earths. He warns all of the heroes that the Anti-Monitor is still alive and that he has retreated into the past to change the course of history at the Dawn of Time itself.\n\nThe heroes migrate to Earth-One to coordinate their efforts, with Superboy of the now-destroyed Earth-Prime joining them. They form their teams and develop a strategy using the time-traveling capabilities of the Time Masters, the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Lord of Time. The Flash (Jay Garrick) and Kid Flash are outfitted with converter technology to help bridge the gap. With the aid of Magno Lad, Cosmic Boy and Gold, the team creates a large magnetic conductor, which shunts the assemblage backwards in time. Superman of Earth-One personally flies Alexander Luthor, Jr. ahead of the time travelers in order for Luthor to open the portal between the universes before they arrive.\n\nMeanwhile, Lex Luthor and his allies travel backwards in time 10 billion years to the planet Oa. They arrive on the fateful day when the scientist Krona is destined to witness the hand of creation and inadvertently create the Multiverse. They burst into his laboratory, but Krona is ready for them. He kills the Icicle, the Mirror Master and Maaldor the Darklord.\n\nAt the dawn of time, the heroes face the Anti-Monitor. They channel all of their energy into him, but this only serves to make the Anti-Monitor more powerful. He requires their energy so that when Krona opens the doorway between the positive matter universe and the Antimatter Universe, the Anti-Monitor will then be able to obliterate the positive matter universe entirely.\n\nThe Spectre appears before the Anti-Monitor, channeling all of the mystical energy of Earth's most powerful sorcerers. He attacks the Anti-Monitor directly and their fight unleashes an explosion of energy, which appears to consume all reality.\n\nAftershock\n\nThe Big Bang happens again, but this time only one universe, with only one Earth, appears.\n\nClark Kent of Earth-Two finds himself in what appears to be his apartment, thinking he is back in his own universe. He dresses up for work and enters into the Daily Planet building unaware, thinking he is entering that of the Daily Star, and enters into Perry White's office, reading the paper until Perry chews him out for being where he doesn't belong. Clark Kent of Earth-One comes on the scene and rescues the other Clark, referring to him as his \"Uncle Clark\" to Perry, while Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen of Earth-One amusingly watch.\n\nOn top of the Daily Planet building, both Clark Kents transform into Superman and fly off to New York City, where the cordoned-off merged section of the Earths was located. However, they find that not only is the merged section no longer present, but also that no one even remembers that there was a cordoned-off section. They fly off to Central City in the hopes of finding Barry Allen's lab when they notice that Central City of Earth-One is now adjacent to Keystone City of Earth-Two. They find Jay Garrick's residence in Keystone City and, surprisingly, Jay Garrick's wife doesn't recognize Superman of Earth-Two, though Jay still does. He has Wally West in his own lab set up the Cosmic Treadmill so they can find out together what's going on.\n\nAs the Flash of Earth-Two, Kid Flash, and both Supermen race the treadmill, they find themselves transported out into a void where the Earth-Two universe should have been. Superman of Earth-Two fears that his wife, Lois Lane-Kent, has vanished along with Earth-Two and chooses to fly out into the void, but Superman of Earth-One stops him and they return back to the New Earth, with the Cosmic Treadmill destroyed. Kid Flash decides it is time to gather all the superheroes together to find out the truth.\n\nMeanwhile, Rip Hunter's time vehicle emerges out of the timestream with the Forgotten Heroes in it. They also notice that time has reset itself. They board Brainiac's skull ship, still floating in space, and see Brainiac still sitting at the controls as he did before the point of time resetting. Dolphin thinks that Brainiac is now dead.\n\nAt the Titans Tower, there is a gathering of present-day superheroes from the various universes, with some trying to figure out why they can't go back to their own universe. To answer that question, Harbinger appears unto them, revealing that with time resetting itself, the five surviving positive-matter universes have all merged into one, with histories from those universes merging into a single history. However, in this universe, there was only one Superman that came from Krypton, only one Bruce Wayne that became Batman, only one Dick Grayson that became Robin, and only one Wonder Woman that came from Paradise Island. This makes Dick Grayson of Earth-Two, the Huntress, and Superman of Earth-Two feel as though they were now \"non-persons\", and it also confuses Power Girl, who in this universe's history is still recognized as a hero, though her Earth-Two cousin isn't.\n\nBatman of Earth-One shows up with Jason Todd and Alexander Luthor, Jr. with more revelations to the group: the supervillains that went back in time to Oa to try preventing Krona's experiment from taking place now don't remember ever taking that trip, as evidenced by Batman talking with Lex Luthor in his prison cell, which means that only those who were there at the Dawn of Time were the ones who remembered, and they were the only ones that survived the universes merging. Superman of Earth-Two realizes from this that his wife is now gone and flies off in a rage, with Superman of Earth-One following to try comforting him for his loss.\n\nMeanwhile, as stormy clouds appear over the Earth, the Phantom Stranger and Deadman look on helplessly at the Spectre floating in midair, unable to help them as they sense that a danger is coming. A housemaid at a Las Vegas hotel finds somebody has died in one of their rooms, and Jonni Thunder finds a triangle beside the body, which one of the detectives with her recognizes as the weapon of the Angle Man. Dr. Fate and Etrigan see that Amethyst is being attacked by people who consider her a witch, and so travel to the scene even as Dr. Occult appears to calm the people with his mystical talisman. The Shadow Demons then appear, and Amethyst tries to fight them off, but she ends up being blinded. Etrigan holds off the demons while Dr. Fate transports Amethyst back to Gemworld. Deep inside a cavern, Cave Carson and his team of explorers see a powerful maelstrom forming within the earth.\n\nBack at Titans Tower, Pariah suffers pain and Alexander Luthor, Jr. experiences himself shifting into starry darkness as the Earth itself is swallowed up from its own universe into another. The two Supermen watch the sky as the face of the Anti-Monitor appears, welcoming the planet's residents to their deaths.\n\nFinal Crisis\n\nIn Brainiac's starship, Dolphin, Captain Comet, Rip Hunter, Animal Man, the Atomic Knight, and Adam Strange convince the reviving robot that his memory was tampered with to make him forget the Crisis. Admitting that his power is inadequate to battle the Anti-Monitor, he sets course for the world of a more powerful being. On Earth, the Anti-Monitor's visage is seen in the skies all over the globe. He repeats that the Earth is now in the Antimatter Universe. His past victories over positive universes are meaningless, he says, because of the super-heroes' efforts to stop him. When he lists Supergirl and the Flash as casualties, Kid Flash demands to know what has happened.\n\nThe Supermen scan the globe and watch the populace panicking. Harbinger appears, and teleports them to a chosen destination, then gathers Dr. Light from Japan, leaving Sunburst to defend the island. When Dr. Light states that she caused Supergirl's death, Harbinger replies that the battle had already killed Supergirl, and that the Anti-Monitor's final attack merely gave her a swift death. In the skies, the darkness splits into a million Shadow Demons, which begin an all-out attack on humanity, and the superheroes mass to resist them. The Global Guardians team with other heroes to free their native lands from the threat, but the demons' numbers seem endless. The Phantom Stranger summons Dr. Mist to help revive the Spectre, who remains comatose. Below, Harbinger has gathered a large group of heroes, along with Pariah and Alex, to lead a final assault on their nemesis. Alex creates a bridge between universes, and they depart near Apokolips.\n\nBrainiac's ship goes into stationary orbit over Apokolips, and he and his guests teleport to the planet, where Darkseid appears and introduces himself.\n\nBack on Earth, the majority of the heroes are still battling the Shadow Demons. The Dove is slain by a shadow-being as his brother, the Hawk, watches in horror.\n\nIn Dr. Fate's Salem tower, the magically powered heroes have gathered to pool their sorcerous might. The Earth-Two Green Lantern and Dr. Occult form the nexus of their energy.\n\nOn Qward, in the Antimatter Universe, Harbinger and the heroes have arrived in the Anti-Monitor's old headquarters. Kid Flash insists on joining them because of his mentor's demise. Suddenly, an image of the Flash appears to him—the last one Barry cast before his death. Wally follows the afterimage to where an insane Psycho-Pirate clutches at an empty uniform. Kid Flash knocks him out and realizes that Barry Allen is truly dead when Lady Quark finds his ring. Pariah informs them that a great concentration of evil lies before them. They follow to find a towering Anti-Monitor, ready for the final slaughter.\n\nIn Atlantis, Aquaman leads his underwater legions against the shadows. Lori Lemaris saves a trapped Mera with a force beam. A demon closes in on her and kills her. In Chicago, Green Arrow of Earth-Two is killed by a shadow. In Philadelphia, Cyborg, the Son of Vulcan, the Vigilante, and the new Wildcat continue rescue operations.\n\nIn New Orleans, Shade, the Changing Man witnesses the death of Prince Ra-Man. In Skartaris, Travis Morgan leads his forces against the black menaces. In Gotham City, both Clayface II and the Bug-Eyed Bandit perish at the hands of the demons. In Salem, the tide finally turns. The sorcerous crusaders send their combined force in a net of energy to gather the demons from the Earth's surface, and bind them helpless in space. Over the Earth, lives have been lost, including those of Kole, Huntress, and Robin of Earth-Two, but other lives have been saved. For a moment, the survivors can take stock.\n\nThe final battle of the Crisis on Infinite Earths\n\nOn Qward, the Supermen of Earth One and Two, Captain Atom, Lady Quark, Firehawk, Wonder Woman, and other heroes strike at the Anti-Monitor, but he ignores their blows, feeding on the energy of a nearby star. As Dr. Light absorbs the energy of one of the binary suns they are between, the Anti-Monitor feels his power draining away. Alex begins to drain the antimatter energy away from their enemy. Negative Woman uses her negative-self to bind the Anti-Monitor and inhibit him; Harbinger then leads all the energy-producing heroes against him, Dr. Light blasts him with the energy of a sun, and he falls into the ruins of his fortress. Alex creates a dimensional hole, large enough to enclose the Earth and return it to its proper universe. The heroes follow. The ball of bound demons hover and then fall on the fallen enemy. Thus, the Anti-Monitor absorbs his slaves energies and rises again, while the heroes start to give battle. Wonder Woman is caught in a withering flash of power, and is borne away to an unknown destination. Superman of Earth-One and Lady Quark vow deadly revenge, but Kal-L knocks them out, and tells Superboy to take them back. Since he has no world and no wife to return to, the elder Superman has the least to lose. Then he confronts the monstrous Anti-Monitor, and batters him. Superboy sends Kal-El and Lady Quark back through Alex's shrinking body, and turns to aid him. Superman continues his one-man war against the Anti-Monitor, striking telling blows, while the villain, his power waning, absorbs more energy from the anti-cosmos, and blasts him and Superboy. Darkseid, watching the conflict on a view screen, proclaims his planet to be endangered if the Anti-Monitor survives, and sends a power burst at him through Alex's eyes. The enemy, devastated, is hurled into the core of one of the binary suns. Superman, Superboy, and Alex are stunned to see the spectre of their enemy rising from the sun. Superman smashes into his foe's fiery body, scattering him: the remains fall back into the sun and the star begins to implode.\n\nThey bravely await the end and Superman wishes that Lois could have lived to see their triumph. At that, Alex produces Lois from a void-pocket in his body where she had been sent to wait. She tells her husband that she had been to a tranquil world. Alex cannot return them to Earth, but he can take them all to this beautiful world. Superman, Lois, and Superboy opt for that choice. The foursome vanish seconds before the exploding sun would have reached them.\n\nBack on Earth, Lyla is explaining facets of the Crisis to Pariah and Lady Quark. Wonder Woman was returned to the clay which Aphrodite and Athena had given life, then spread across Paradise Island.\n\nTime then continued to reverse itself, as the Amazons were returned to their original homeland before they fled Man's World. Zeus brought the homeless Wonder Woman of Earth-Two and her husband Steve Trevor to Olympus, where they could live peacefully. The bodies of Robin of Earth-Two, the Huntress, and Kole were never found. All those who died were mourned. In Keystone City, Jay Garrick determined that Kid Flash's illness was in remission, his body chemistry being changed by a blast from the Anti-Monitor. He could again move at super-speed, though only at the speed of sound. Wally donned Barry Allen's uniform, and announced, \"From this day forth — the Flash lives again!\"\n\nThe Great Disaster will not exist in the Earth's future, but a lost child will he found in Command D., adopted by General Horatio Tomorrow of the Planeteers, and named Thomas. Jonah Hex will be torn from his era to fight in the future, while the Guardians of the Universe must face the first division in their ranks. Thus, Lyla concludes her tale, and Lady Quark and Pariah ask her to help them explore their new homeworld. They leave with her, honoring the memory of their benefactor, the Monitor. And, in Arkham Asylum, the staff discuss a new patient who seems beyond help, straitjacketed in a rubber-lined room. Roger Hayden, formerly the Psycho-Pirate, gibbers about Earths beyond numbers, the Anti-Monitor, and the memories, which only he had been allowed to keep.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThe Monitor's plans did not completely work against the Anti-Monitor, ultimately costing the Monitor his life. Five universes remained. The heroes, at the Spectre's urging, pool their resources and travel back to the Dawn of Time when they confront the Anti-Monitor. Meanwhile, the villains travel (1,000,000,000 years later) to Oa to try to stop Krona from peering back in time and creating the Multiverse (and the Antimatter Universe that the Anti-Monitor came from).\n\nThe Anti-Monitor reveals that he lured the heroes to him to absorb their life forces. He explains:\n\nOnly here, before creation, can the future be changed! When Krona taps the cosmic forces, opening the door between matter and antimatter ... it shall be my hand he sees! My hand which shall destroy the positive matter multiverse for now and forever! My hand which shall make the antimatter universe supreme! ... The Multiverse will no longer exist! [1]\n\nHowever the Spectre, aided by Earth's mightiest sorcerers, managed to (apparently) defeat him.\n\nAs Krona peers back through the cosmic veil, the Big Bang occurs:\n\nIn the beginning there were many. A Multiversal infinitude...so cold and so dark for so very long...that even the burning light was imperceptible. But then the light grew, and the Multiverse shuddered...and the darkness screamed as much in pain as in relief. For in that instant a Universe was born. A Universe with mighty worlds orbiting burning suns. A Universe reborn at the Dawn of Time. What had been many became one.[2]\n\nThe resulting reality was able to resist the Anti-Monitor's attacks due to the successful depowering efforts brought about mostly identified in battles noted to Supergirl and the Flash which cost them both their lives. Vastly depowered, the Anti-Monitor attacked the resulting Earth directly where he was finally killed by Kal-L. With both \"Monitors\" dead, the resulting primary Earth underwent further changes and readjusted into a new state of existence which differed in many major ways from its preceding versions. The universe reformated all of its inhabitants to be native to its history and timeline which conflicted with the previous multi-dimensional originating people now in it, such as Power Girl.\n\nSome would be changed in the later Zero Hour/Hyper-Time event, whereby the existence of infinite dimensions would again be accessible in the DC primary reality (other dimensions existed, but were completely inaccessible and thus termed \"Elseworlds Stories\"). But interaction with these other dimensions was unstable and these separate realities' influences threatened to destroy the singular DC New Earth. This would be the same occurrence when the Dark Flash entered into the DC primary reality. [3]\n\nIt would not be until the later Infinite Crisis occurrence that stable extradimensional realities would be shown to exist within the DC universe again.\n\nConvergence nullified the Crisis by preventing the destruction of the Multiverse but, as Brainiac noted, \"Each world has evolved but they all still exist.\" All that is known is that the Kents, the Flash, Supergirl, and Parallax were successful in preventing the collapse of the Multiverse as well as the original deaths of the Flash and Supergirl. Superman and his family and Parallax relocated to Prime Earth while Barry and Kara left for parts unknown in order to seek their destinies elsewhere.[4] [5]\n\nYears later, it was eventually that the two central figures of the Crisis event itself were champions of both The Presence and The Great Darkness, with Mar Novu a.k.a. the Monitor being one of many who was created by The Presence to monitor the Multiverse whereas the Anti-Monitor being one of many who was cursed by The Great Darkness to obliterate the Multiverse with the superheroes themselves acting as the Multiverse's immune system against the Great Darkness' machinations.\n\nHowever, when the Multiverse had been destroyed by the aforementioned Crisis event and had been reborn into just one single universe, The Presence was greatly weakened as a result which gave the Great Darkness the opportunity to attack The Presence itself. Even though several superheroes had tried their best to fight back against the now-sentient primordial darkness, they were soon defeated with the Great Darkness almost succeeding in achieving its' goal but a last minute intervention by the Swamp Thing had convinced the Great Darkness to form a truce with The Presence and the end result of the aforementioned truce was that The Presence would no longer make its influence be as prominent as it was before and the Great Darkness would no longer actively attempt to destroy The Presence, along with agreeing to render itself dormant.\n\nIssues\n\nCore Issues:\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #1\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #2\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #3\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #4\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #5\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #6\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #7\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #8\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #9\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #10\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #11\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #12\n\nCrossovers:\n\nAll-Star Squadron #50\nAll-Star Squadron #51\nAll-Star Squadron #52\nAll-Star Squadron #53\nAll-Star Squadron #54\nAll-Star Squadron #55\nAll-Star Squadron #56\nAmethyst (Volume 2) #13\nBlue Devil #17\nBlue Devil #18\nDC Comics Presents #86\nDC Comics Presents #87\nDC Comics Presents #88\nFirestorm (Volume 2) #41\nFirestorm (Volume 2) #42\nGreen Lantern (Volume 2) #194\nGreen Lantern (Volume 2) #195\nGreen Lantern (Volume 2) #198\nInfinity Inc. #18\nInfinity Inc. #19\nInfinity Inc. #20\nInfinity Inc. #21\nInfinity Inc. #22\nInfinity Inc. #23\nInfinity Inc. #24\nInfinity Inc.

Some characters were unfortunate enough to have actually died during the Crisis, as well as having their existence erased from human memory.\n\nAnti-Monitor, destroyed by the Earth-Two Superman, resurrected in Blackest Night;\nCaptain Storm\nDove (Don Hall), killed by Shadow Demons; however, in the remade reality he was betrayed by the Lords of Order and Chaos who took away his powers and he was left vulnerable to be smashed by a falling wall;\nFarmer Boy, killed by Shadow Demons; however, in the remade reality his current whereabouts are unknown;\nFlash (Barry Allen), died stopping the anti-matter cannon; the current Barry Allen is his past version before his death;\nGunner\nHuntress (Helena Wayne), killed in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12, erased;\nJohnny Cloud\nJohnny Quick (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nJulia Remarque, the Pre-Crisis Alfred and Mademoiselle Marie's daughter; erased from existence since the Post-Crisis Alfred is considerably younger than Marie and they never had a relationship;\nKid Psycho, killed by the anti-matter wave; however, in the remade reality his current whereabouts are unknown;\nAlexander Luthor, Sr. (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nLois Lane (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nKole, killed by Shadow Demons, but the memories of her existence were not erased;\nMonitor, killed by Harbinger;\nNighthawk, killed by the anti-matter wave; however, in the remade reality he was killed by Wild West outlaw Mathilda Roderic (Nighthawk is an incarnation of Khufu and was reincarnated as Hawkman);\nOwlman (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nPower Ring (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nSarge\nSolovar, killed by Shadow Demons; however, in the remade reality he is alive;\nSupergirl (Earth-One), killed by the Anti-Monitor, replaced by the Matrix (Pocket Universe) and later by the Post-Crisis Supergirl;\nSuper-Woman (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nUltraman (Earth-Three), dissolved by the anti-matter wave, erased;\nHippolyta (Earth-One), survived the Crisis, replaced by the Post-Crisis Hippolyta;\nJimmy Olsen (Earth-One) survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Jimmy Olsen;\nLana Lang (Earth-One) survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Lana Lang;\nLois Lane (Earth-One) survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Lois Lane;\nSunburst, killed in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12, but did not die in New Earth's timeline;\nRobin (Earth-Two), killed in Crisis on Infinite Earths #12, erased;\nSteven Trevor (Earth-One), survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Steve Trevor;\nSteven Trevor (Earth-Two), went to the Pre-Crisis Olympus, survived as extra-dimensional outside of the main universe;\nSuperman (Earth-One), survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Superman (most of his supporting characters and villains were replaced by their Post-Crisis versions);\nWonder Woman (Earth-One), reverted to clay at the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths and effectively killed, erased; replaced by the Post-Crisis Wonder Woman\nWonder Woman (Earth-Two), went to the Pre-Crisis Olympus; survived as extra-dimensional outside of the main universe;\nCaptain Atom (Earth-Four), survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Captain Atom;\nCaptain Marvel (Earth-S), survived the Crisis; replaced by the Post-Crisis Captain Marvel.\nTrivia\nGeorge Perez claimed in a 1994 interview that Chris Claremont, famous for his 17-year run on The Uncanny X-Men, suggested that the Earth-One Superman died killing the Anti-Monitor; since his history had been the one to survive the alteration of history, the new Earth was now without a Superman. In this scenario, the Earth-Two Superman, after considering the fact that his wife and friends are now all gone, would look at the heroes surrounding him and say, \"Well, guess I don't need this anymore\" and begin to wipe old-age make-up from his face and white hair dye from his temples. He would then explain that he had stopped physically aging in the 1940s when his powers reached their peak. This Superman would then return to Earth with the other heroes and assume his younger counterpart's life. The thrust of the Post-Crisis Superman reboot would then be \"The Return of the Original Super-Hero,\" with the Earth-Two Superman learning to live his life as a younger Clark Kent in the modern world.\n\n\n\n\nLinks and References\nPage by page, panel by panel annotations of the series\n\n↑ Crisis on Infinite Earths #10\n↑ Crisis on Infinite Earths #11\n↑ The Flash (Volume 2) #159\n↑ Superman: Lois and Clark #1\n↑ Green Lantern (Volume 5) #49\n↑ Action Comics #1008\n↑ Justice League (Volume 4) #75\nCrisis\nEvents\tCrisis on Multiple Earths | Crisis on Infinite Earths | Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! | Infinite Crisis | Final Crisis | Flashpoint | Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths\nZero Hour Related Events\tEnd of an Era\nCountdown to Infinite Crisis\tCountdown to Infinite Crisis #1 | The OMAC Project | Rann-Thanagar War | Villains United | Day of Vengeance\nInfinite Crisis Aftermath\t52 | One Year Later | World War III | Battle for Blüdhaven\nCountdown to Final Crisis\tDeath of the New Gods | Salvation Run | Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer | Countdown to Adventure | Countdown to Mystery | Countdown Presents: Lord Havok and the Extremists | Countdown: Arena\nFinal Crisis Related Events\tFinal Crisis | Final Crisis: Revelations | Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds | Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge\nFlashpoint Related Events\tTime Masters: Vanishing Point\nRoad to Dark Crisis\tInfinite Frontier | Justice League Incarnate\nSee Also\tIdentity Crisis (crossovers) | Heroes in Crisis | Dark Nights: Death Metal | Crisis on Infinite Earths Crossovers | Zero Hour Crossovers | Infinite Crisis Crossovers | Final Crisis Crossovers | Dark Crisis Crossovers | Convergence\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths Crossover\nThe events from this issue or series are related to the Crisis on Infinite Earths, a reality-spanning event which led to the destruction of the original Pre-Crisis Multiverse.\nThis template will categorize articles that include it into the Crisis on Infinite Earths category.\n\nCollapse\nCore Issues\nCrisis on Infinite Earths #1 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #2 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #3 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #4 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #5 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #6 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #8 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #9 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #10 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #11 • Crisis on Infinite Earths #12\nCollapse\nTie-Ins\nAll-Star Squadron #50 • All-Star Squadron #51 • All-Star Squadron #52 • All-Star Squadron #53 • All-Star Squadron #54 • All-Star Squadron #55 • All-Star Squadron #56 • Amethyst (Volume 2) #13 • Blue Devil #17 • Blue Devil #18 • DC Comics Presents #86 • DC Comics Presents #87 • DC Comics Presents #88 • Firestorm (Volume 2) #41 • Firestorm (Volume 2) #42 • Green Lantern (Volume 2) #194 • Green Lantern (Volume 2) #195 • Green Lantern (Volume 2) #198 • Infinity Inc. #18 • Infinity Inc. #19 • Infinity Inc. #20 • Infinity Inc. #21 • Infinity Inc. #22 • Infinity Inc. #23 • Infinity Inc. #24 • Infinity Inc.

Formally known as Task Force X, the team's actions are highly classified, and the government is able to deny any involvement by claiming that they are not responsible for the damages of a random super-villain attack. Their commander is Amanda Waller, who runs the organization out of Belle Reve prison. Surgically implanted with remote explosives in their necks to discourage them from disobeying orders, the roster for the squad constantly changes and members of the group are often killed during missions.\n\nThe first Suicide Squad was created by Robert Kanigher and Ross Andru, first appearing in The Brave and the Bold #25 (1959).\n\nThe more famous version of the team was created by John Ostrander and Len Wein as well as by penciler John Byrne, first appearing in Legends #3 (1987).\n\nSuicide Squad\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nTask Force X\nNew Earth\n(other versions)\nSuicide

The story is told through an eponymous seven-issue miniseries although tie-ins span the entire DC Universe. There were four lead-in miniseries' published as part of Countdown to Infinite Crisis, including Day of Vengeance, The OMAC Project, Rann-Thanagar War and Villains United. Its conclusion was followed by the One Year Later event skipping ahead a full year in the timeline, while the missing year was explored in the 52 event.\n\nThe story returns to concepts established at the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths when Alex Luthor, Lois Lane of Earth-Two, Superboy-Prime and Superman of Earth-Two disappeared as the last surviving heroes of the destroyed Multiverse. It is revealed that they have been monitoring the heroes of New Earth as they descend into darkness, and believe this generation to be unworthy of their legacy. They return to bring back the Multiverse, in an effort to restore the idealistic values of their own time.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tCountdown to Infinite Crisis\n1.2\tInfinite Crisis\n1.3\tCrossovers\n1.3.1\tAquaman\n1.3.2\tBatman\n1.3.3\tBirds of Prey\n1.3.4\tFirestorm\n1.3.5\tGreen Arrow\n1.3.6\tGreen Lantern\n1.3.7\tJustice Society\n1.3.8\tJustice League\n1.3.9\tNightwing\n1.3.10\tOutsiders\n1.3.11\tRobin\n1.3.12\tSuperman\n1.3.13\tTeen Titans\n2\tIssues\n2.1\tMain Series\n2.2\tCountdown to Infinite Crisis\n2.3\tInfinite Crisis Special\n2.4\tTie-Ins\n2.5\tAftermath\n3\tNotes\n4\tTrivia\n5\tLinks and References\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.\nHistory\nCountdown to Infinite Crisis\n\n Main article: Countdown to Infinite Crisis\n\nMax Lord of Checkmate is exposed for developing hero-killing cyborgs called OMACs, and kills his old friend Blue Beetle for uncovering his plans.[1] Lord takes control of Checkmate and begins using these OMACs to attack heroes across the world.[2] He is killed by Wonder Woman for mind-controlling Superman, although this does not stop his plans.[3] The Spectre loses his human host and is seduced by Eclipso into destroying all of magic by killing every magic-user.[4] Adam Strange's planet Rann and Hawkman's planet Thanagar enter a massive war, which begins shifting the center of the universe.[5] Black Adam, Calculator, Deathstroke, Doctor Psycho, Lex Luthor and Talia al Ghul form a new Secret Society of Super-Villains to organize the villain community and fight back against the heroes together.[6] Donna Troy returns from the dead.[7]\n\nInfinite Crisis\n\nAfter the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, it is shown that the characters who entered the \"heaven\" do not end up very pleased. Their new realm was crystal-like and responds to the emotions of the inhabitants, Superboy-Prime, Alexander Luthor, Superman of Earth-Two, and Lois Lane of Earth-Two. Superboy-Prime is constantly shown his ninth birthday party and his first time that he used his powers. These happy recordings cause Superboy-Prime to become unstable and he lusts to be returned to his Earth. Out of rage and frustration, Superboy-Prime punches the walls of their realm and sends a ripple effect throughout the universe, as well as where they are. This wave causes reality to reconstruct certain aspects of itself and make history like it was supposed to be on all of the individual Earths that were destroyed. Some instances were the resurrection of the Doom Patrol and Jason Todd. These waves also caused the Lois Lane of Earth-Two to become weak. Another revelation is made by Alexander Luthor, and he realizes that he could have sent them to Darkseid's domain and returned to Earth instead of going to the crystalline \"heaven\". Believing that New Earth is imperfect and needs to be replaced, Alexander Luthor powers up Superboy-Prime and enables him to breach their realm. After this, Alexander Luthor steals control of Brother Eye from Batman, forms a new Secret Society of Super-Villains (known here simply as \"the Society\") to strike out at Earth's heroes, and plans for the Spectre to wreak havoc on the people of magic. Superboy-Prime destroyed the Justice League Watchtower and took Martian Manhunter hostage, triggered a war between Rann and Thanagar, and recovered the corpse of the Anti-Monitor.\n\nWhile at the Watchtower, the trinity of DC, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman debate the current situation on Earth. Batman makes clear that Superman needs to be on Earth and help, and that Wonder Woman has crossed the line in killing Maxwell Lord. After a brief combat with Mongul, they part ways and join the fight. Kon-El is also contemplating whether or not he should interfere while he stays at the Kent farm. During this time, OMACs have been destroying all of the metahuman population, most recently being Ratcatcher. After discovering the whereabouts of Nightwing, the OMACs depart on an alternative assignment. To add to the fray, Gotham City is under attack by multiple lethal villains along with the Spectre.\n\nIn an attempt to discover what the Society is up to, the Freedom Fighters raid an \"abandoned\" refinery and are greeted by Deathstroke, Doctor Polaris, Sinestro, Bizarro, Zoom, Psycho-Pirate, Black Adam, Cheetah, and Doctor Light. Here, all of the Freedom Fighters are killed in a slaughter except for Uncle Sam. The Society's only casualty is Doctor Polaris, who is killed by the Human Bomb.\n\nAfter Alexander Luthor convinces Superman of Earth-Two to destroy their realm, they head out to try to re-create the world for the better.\n\nSoon after this, Animal Man is transported to New Cronus, the base for a defense group against the crisis. At the same time, Power Girl is attacked by the combined efforts of Clayface, Psycho-Pirate, Giganta, and others. After she is about to be defeated, Superman of Earth-Two comes to her rescue and defeats all of them with ease. He then says to Power Girl, \"It's been a long time, cousin. Too long.\" Then they fly back to a hidden Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic where Power Girl meets all of the group from the \"heaven\". Alexander Luthor reveals that she must have fallen through a crack in reality and been reworked into the current reality. She is also given a detailed explanation of the universe, which is twisted into saying that the current Age of Heroes is too dark. Power Girl also regains her memories of her previous self. After realizing that Batman was right, Superman flies into action to fight the crisis. He then meets up with the Shadowpact while stopping a building from collapsing. Realizing that Captain Marvel is nowhere to be found, Alexander Luthor, as Lex Luthor, orders Black Adam to be taken in instead. He also has Brother Eye taunt Batman about him not being in control of it any more. Currently it is shown to the world the battle of Themyscira versus the OMACs, the Joker is told that he cannot enter the Society, and the Superman of Earth-Two reveals that they are planning to make Earth-Two the template for the current reality instead of Earth-One.\n\nIn order to distract Earth's heroes from their plans, the Society drops Chemo onto the city of Blüdhaven, killing millions. Afterwards, Superboy-Prime goes to Smallville to \"talk\" with the modern Superboy. A fight breaks out between the two of them throughout the state of Kansas, which leads them to Keystone City, where Conner uses his Titans communicator to contact not only the Titans, but the Justice Society, the Doom Patrol, and others. After accidentally killing a few of the heroes, Superboy-Prime is attacked by Jay Garrick, Wally West, and Kid Flash, and taken into the Speed Force, with Jay falling out just before they break into the dimension. Flash is then converted into energy, taking his wife Linda and his twin children, leaving Bart all alone to battle the psychotic Superboy-Prime. Then, he gets help from three of the residents of the Speed Force, his grandfather Barry Allen, Johnny Quick, and Max Mercury, and they all take Superboy-Prime into the Speed Force.\n\nAfter considering Alex's plans to recreate Earth-Two, Power Girl goes back to the Fortress to tell them that she wants to bring in some of the heroes of this Earth into the fold, when she sees Luthor's true plan, a tuning fork similar to the ones used in the first Crisis, but this time, it has been combined with the corpse of the Anti-Monitor. Before she can escape, she's knocked out by Superboy-Prime. In the meantime, Kal-L goes to meet the current Batman, who is interested in the idea of the recreation of Earth-Two. Superman tells him of the people that used to live on Earth-Two, including that world's version of Batman, who grew up to get married and have a child. When Batman asks him if the Robin of Earth-Two is better than Dick Grayson, Superman says no, which is what Batman believed and takes out the kryptonite in his possession. But, since Kryptonians are only affected by the kryptonite of their dimension, this kryptonite has no effect on Kal-L, who uses his heat vision to destroy it and leaves to go back to his wife in the Fortress.\n\nAfter programming Brother Eye and the OMACs to surround the tower, we see that the people that have been captured by him are people that are from the Earths of the original Multiverse: the Martian Manhunter of Earth-One, Power Girl of Earth-Two, Black Adam of Earth-S, Nightshade of Earth-Four, Lady Quark of Earth-Six, and Breach of Earth-Eight, which he needs to recreate not only the core Earths that were merged in the first Crisis, but the entire Multiverse itself. He uses the Psycho-Pirate to use his power on Black Adam to say the word \"Shazam\", which powers up the tower, and Earth-Two is recreated with the people native to that world, including the Justice Society, Kal-L and his wife Lois are transported there.\n\nOn Earth-Two, the Justice Society have no idea where they are, but Superman and Lois are happy to be back on Earth-Two in front of the Daily Star. However, Lois is still weak from their travels, and eventually dies. Kal-L lets out a huge scream, which shatters the glass around him and cracks the concrete beneath him. The scream is so loud that even the modern Superman can hear it and he flies off to Earth-Two. When he gets there, he sees the Superman and Lois of that world and wonders what is going on. Kal-L blames Superman for bringing the corruption of Earth-One into Earth-Two and attacks him and they battle it out, which destroys much of Earth-Two's Metropolis before Wonder Woman stops the fight. Kal-L berates them for not being perfect, but Superman tells him that a perfect Earth doesn't need a Superman, which stops Kal-L and he goes back to the body of his wife.\n\nAfter being healed from his fight with Superboy-Prime, Superboy goes to Titans Tower and finds only Nightwing. With the other Titans dealing with the disasters around the globe, they are the only ones who go to the tower in the Arctic, where they are joined by Wonder Girl, and they launch an attack on Alex's tower and free the heroes that are plugged into it. Meanwhile, in Japan, Doctor Light notices that the Flash has returned, but it's Bart, who's aged and in his grandfather's uniform. He tells them that Superboy-Prime escaped the Speed Force wearing an armor based on the Anti-Monitor's that constantly feeds him yellow sunlight.\n\nWith the tower activated, Alex fires a beam at Kal-L that brings back the rest of the Multiverse, sending the rest of the people of Earth to their native Earths, including Earth-S, Earth-898, and even Earth-Three. Alex sifts through the Earths and tries to merge different Earths together in order to create the perfect Earth. Kal-L realizes that Alex has been using him all this time and flies with Superman and Wonder Woman back to Earth-One, but they don't know where it is since the sky is covered with dozens of parallel Earths.\n\nSuperboy-Prime goes to the tower and attacks the heroes, and gets Alex to stop merging different Earths together and to find Earth-Prime. The two Superboys resume their fight, with the infinitely-powered psychopath clearly beating Kon-El by breaking his wrist. Instead, Superboy flies into Prime and they both go through the tower, destroying not only it, but Alex's Multiverse, bringing all of the Earths back together and remerging the Earths back into one New Earth, sacrificing his life when the two Supermen, Wonder Woman, and Batman arriving too late as Superboy dies in Wonder Girl's arms.\n\nThe Multiverse is merged again and a New Earth is born out of it\n\nThe Society launched its most ambitious plan yet when it staged a worldwide prison break from every prison/facility that held supervillains. Oracle and Martian Manhunter coordinated the Earth's superheroes as they tried to contain as many escapees as possible. In the meanwhile, Dr. Psycho and Warp freed Doomsday from his prison at the center of the Earth. The Six reappeared and managed to question Scarecrow as to what the Society planned to do next. Scarecrow told them that the Society was going to use the escaped villains to launch a massive assault on Metropolis as the first step towards world domination. The Six told Green Arrow, who then told Oracle, who then had the heroes of Earth gather in Metropolis to stop the Society's army.\n\nPanel of several heroes mourning the death of Superboy\n\nThe battle that followed was brutal, with both sides suffering massive casualties; the hero Judomaster had his back broken by Bane, both the Trigger Twins and the Madmen were shot by Wild Dog, Crimson Avenger, and Vigilante, Amazo was beheaded by Black Adam, and Solomon Grundy and the Bloodpack were killed by Superboy-Prime. The fight turned in the heroes' favor when several heroes that had been missing, including Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Batman, Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandmark), and Nightwing, arrived on the scene. Superman and the Superman of Earth-Two took down Doomsday. Alex Luthor attacked the heroes, but his powers began to fade. Batman tried to kill him, but was talked out of it by Wonder Woman. Just then, a collapse of some debris separated Alex Luthor from the heroes. The battle then came to a close with the heroes triumphing and the Society facing heavy losses.\n\nSuperboy-Prime, knowing that he can't bring back Earth-Prime, flies out of the battle at light speed, planning to go to Oa and absorb the Green Lantern Central Power Battery to create a Big Bang to his preferences. The Martian Manhunter alerts the other heroes of Prime's plans through telepathy and tells those who can fly to go after him. Kal-L grabs Prime and tries to talk him out of it, but Prime doesn't want to listen and, in a flash, is light years ahead of them. Hal Jordan then alerts Guy Gardner of the coming threat and mobilizes the Green Lantern Corps, who manage to create a three hundred-mile wall of pure will, which slows him down long enough for the two Supermen to grab him and take him away. They take him through the remains of Krypton, and then through the red sun Rao, which destroys his armor, and they all crash onto the Green Lantern planet Mogo, where Superboy-Prime kills Kal-L by pummeling him to death and almost does the same with Kal-El, saying that when Kal-El is gone, then he will be Superman. At that, Kal-El rips the S-shield off of Superboy-Prime's chest, saying that he will never be Superman because he has no idea of what it means to be Superman, that it isn't about power or the symbol but about what he does with it. After Kal-El defeats Superboy-Prime, the Green Lantern Corps show up to destroy the kryptonite that fell on the planet and to encase Superboy-Prime in a holding casket until he is brought to Oa for imprisonment. Power Girl weeps as her Earth-Two cousin dies, fearing that she will be left alone again, but Kal-L assures her that he will always be with her even if she can't see him, for he now sees what his wife has seen when she died.\n\nAs the heroes return to Earth to mourn for their dead, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman find themselves needing time to recover, not just physically but also spiritually as heroes. As Diana flies off in her invisible jet to find out who she really is, and Batman goes on a journey with Dick Grayson and Tim Drake to rebuild Batman, Clark joins with his wife Lois realizing that, even though he will need time to recharge his powers, Earth will be in pretty good hands with enough heroes present to take care of things.\n\nA short time later, Alexander Luthor was sprayed with acid and electrocuted by the Joker for not letting him join the Society. He is then shot in the head and killed by the Joker.\n\nOn Oa, Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner are heading to a memorial for the Green Lanterns that were recently killed, and observe the special prison used to house the renegade Kryptonian. Too dangerous to be held in the Sciencells, the Guardians have placed Superboy-Prime's cell in a junior red Sun-Eater given to them by Donna Troy, to be watched by fifty Green Lanterns at all times. In his cell, the Kryptonian etches a bloody S-shield on his bare chest, saying that he's been in worse places than this and he's gotten out.\n\nCrossovers\nAquaman\n\n Main article: Aquaman: All Fall Down\n\n\n\n\nBatman\n\n Main article: Batman: Under the Hood\n\n\n\n\nBirds of Prey\n\n Main article: Birds of Prey: Perfect Pitch\n\n\n\n\nFirestorm\n\n Main article: Firestorm: Building a Better Firestorm\n\n\n\n\nGreen Arrow\n\n Main article: Green Arrow: Heading into the Light\n\n\n\n\nGreen Lantern\n\n Main article: Green Lantern: A Perfect Life\n\n\n\n\nJustice Society\n\n Main article: JSA: Lost & Found\n\n\n\n\nJustice League\n\n Main article: JLA: World Without a Justice League\n\n\n\n\nNightwing\n\n Main article: Nightwing: Renegade\n\n\n\n\nOutsiders\n\n Main article: Outsiders: Crisis Intervention\n\nThe Secret Society of Super-Villains targets the Outsiders.

Inspired by the legend of Superboy, they were founded by Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad, and Saturn Girl under the funding of an eccentric millionaire they had saved named R.J. Brande. This cast expands to include dozens of members with a diverse array of powers and personalities. There have been several versions of the team in main continuity because of the constantly changing nature of the future, including the Reboot Legion and the Prime Legion. The Legion of Super-Heroes were created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino, first appearing in Adventure Comics #247. (1958) Mark Waid, Tom McCraw and Stuart Immonen engineered a reboot of the team following Zero Hour in Legion of Super-Heroes (Volume 4) #0. (1994) There was another reboot of the team by Mark Waid and Barry Kitson, starting in Teen Titans/The Legion Special #1. (2004) Yet another reboot came from Brian Michael Bendis and Ryan Sook, beginning with Superman (Volume 5) #14. They appeared after the previous timeline was erased during Doomsday Clock.

The New 52 came out of the Flashpoint event. In September, 2011, DC Comics consolidated and relaunched their comic lines, discontinuing some series, and introducing yet other series, resulting in 52 titles, each with a new #1. That consolidation included the incorporation of both the Wildstorm Productions and the reincorporation of certain Vertigo properties into the mainstream DC Universe. The event takes its name from the company's thematic associations with the number 52, which began with the publication of the weekly series 52, in which it was revealed that a Multiverse of 52 parallel realities existed within the DC Universe.

First, the Knight Terrors event lead to widespread fear and distrust of superheroes, giving Waller the opening she needed. Waller gave the helmet and Insomnia's Nightmare Stone to Raven's missing half known as Doctor Hate.[5] After Beast Boy defeated a Star Conqueror known as The Necrostar by transforming into one himself, she sent Doctor Hate to wipe his mind. Reduced to a feral state, Beast Boy attacked the world himself, spreading spores around the world that transformed superheroes into Beast-People, an event known as Beast World. This made the rest of the world fear superheroes as much as she did, so they would be more accepting of the government slaughtering them.[6] Waller used the ensuing chaos to convince the President to activate the \"Bureau of Sovereignty\" and grant her sweeping executive powers.[7] She used this power to remove Lex Luthor from prison and force him to use a stolen Justice League Teleporter to teleport Chester Runk inside Beast Boy; seemingly killing them both.[8][9] She then ordered the remaining Beast-People to be herded together and killed by drone strikes, adding up to the murder of over a million people. She believed this would cause people to look to tyrannical governments rather than heroes for protection, and allow her to become the de-facto dictator of the USA.[10]\n\nCyborg prevented the genocide by hacking into the US military's system and calling the drones off. Nightwing then personally met with the President and convinced him to let the Titans try and save the Beast-People rather than destroy them. The president agreed and the Titans were able to draw the spores out of people by using powerful heroes as bait; even successfully reconstituting Beast Boy. However, people were frightened by the Titans' display of power and impunity, and the Bureau of Sovereignty became more popular. Waller took over the abandoned Hall of Justice, renaming it the \"Hall of Order\".[11]\n\nTitans\n\nDuring the events of Beast World the Titans destroyed the Helmet of Hate and Raven battled her evil half, but Doctor Hate was able to overpower Raven and trap her in a gem, then assume her counterpart's identity.[11] Trigon became concerned that interacting with the Titans may cause Doctor Hate to turn to good, and so made a deal with Waller to remove their influence from her.[12] He manipulated Trilogy into attacking her and Doctor Hate easily overpowered him. Doctor Hate trapped Trilogy in another soul gem, beginning to build her \"Crown of Cages\" which would unlock her ultimate power as the \"Dark-Winged Queen\". Meanwhile, Waller commissioned T.O. Morrow to build a cyborg known as Vanadia to destroy the Titans, programming her to believe the Titans were monstrous impostors.[13] Vanadia proved too much for the Titans to handle and Doctor Hate was injured. She retreated to Hell to heal and took up Trigon's staff, declaring that she would not allow harm to come to her \"generals\", the Titans.[14] Raven told her darker half that she could tell Hate actually cared about the Titans and didn't want them hurt, but Dark Raven insisted that her interest was purely tactical. The Titans were able to restrain Vanadia and convince her of the truth; but as soon as they did Dark Raven teleported in and destroyed her.[15]\n\nThe Quintessence learned what had happened. Fearing what Dark Raven would do if she assumed her full power, Hera informed Blaze, the new ruler of Hell of the threat. Raven's half-brothers Belial and Suge went to Earth to try and stop her; Hera sent The Spectre to assist them.[16] Unfortunately, the combined forces of Heaven and Hell failed and the three of them were also imprisoned in soul gems. With her \"Crown of Cages\" complete, the Dark Winged Queen assumed her true form and Trigon manifested on Earth.\n\nNightwing sent out an emergency broadcast, calling on every hero on Earth to help.[17] Waves of heroes arrived and Trigon battled them, easily defeating them all. However, the Dark Winged Queen simply watched. At Beast Boy's direction, Tempest destroyed the central gem in the \"Crown of Cages\" which held Raven, freeing her. Raven squared off with her counterpart, but Beast Boy asked her to put the three of them in a psychic link. He pointed out that Dark Raven had not actually harmed anyone since losing the Helmet of Hate, and that she had the ability to choose who she wanted to be rather than accept the \"destiny\" Trigon had planned for her. Raven and Dark Raven fused together into a single entity, and Raven harnessed the full power of the Titans to defeat Trigon and banish him back to Hell.[18]\n\nGreen Arrow\n\nWaller also worked with Malcolm Merlyn to prevent Team Arrow from ever fully uniting, under the pretence that they would be responsible for a \"Great Disaster\", implanting devices in their necks which randomly teleported them around time and space if they ever gathered in large numbers.[19] When Arsenal and Cheshire broke into her secret base, looking for information on their missing daughter, they discovered that she was spying on every superhero on Earth. Waller ambushed and gunned them down with Peacemaker and Peacewrecker.[20] Oliver Queen eventually returned from exile in space and discovered that the Justice League had disbanded in his absence. He strongly suspected that Waller had somehow engineered the dissolution of the League to weaken the superhero community ahead of some major move against them.[21]\n\nIn fact Arsenal was not killed, and instead began working for Waller, as she had implanted a bomb in his brain and was holding Cheshire hostage.[22] Oliver broke into the Hall of Order looking for information on Roy and Waller's plan. He was caught, and Waller asked him to join her for the war she claimed was coming between superhumans and normal people. He refused but she promised to reunite his family and deliver Merlyn to him if he helped her. The first thing she ordered him to do was steal the records from Sanctuary for her.[3] Oliver agreed when she told him that Arsenal had disappeared on the same mission.[23] He successfully obtained the records and saved Roy, but refused to hand them over unless Waller delivered Merlyn to him. In response, she teleported him to the post-Great Disaster future to face Merlyn.[24] In the future Merlyn attacked Green Arrow with an army of holograms, but Oliver used the implants to bring all of Team Arrow to the future with him and they defeated the holograms. Oliver then beat Merlyn in an archery duel and handed him over to John Diggle to be imprisoned. Team Arrow returned to the present, disabling the teleport implants for good.[25]\n\nAs part of his deal with Waller, she demanded that Oliver work for the Bureau of Sovereingty. He agreed, intending to go undercover as a manchurian agent and bring it down from the inside. As Waller had psychics working for her who would have detected his intentions, he had Martian Manhunter implant a telepathic suggestion in his mind which made him genuinely believe in Waller's mission. This self-brainwashing was timed to end after a certain period had passed and Waller was no longer watching his every move.[26]\n\nAfter spending a day celebrating with Team Arrow, Oliver snuck away in the night and joined up with the Bureau of Sovereignty. He originally only agreed to guard the weapons and technology that Waller seized from the people she arrested. However, Waller was quickly able to manipulate him into taking missions in the field by sending him to arrest superheroes who had gone \"rogue\". Oliver was forced to agree so he could attempt to bring his friends in non-lethally, whereas the Bureau's other operatives would have killed them on sight.[27][28]\n\nDreamer\n\nAs another part of her larger plan, Waller drafted Dreamer into the Suicide Squad by threatening to reveal the location of her hidden hometown of Parthas if she did not cooperate. Dreamer reluctantly joined the Squad, but had dreams of a future filled with death and carnage caused by Amanda Waller.[29][30]\n\nDreamer's first mission with the Squad was to overthrow the new democratic government of Gamorra, so the Bureau of Sovereignty could use it as a staging ground and prison for America's superheroes. Nia went along with it up to a point, but when the Squad began murdering Gamorran soldiers she attempted to stop them. Following his conditioning, Bizarro tried to kill her and she fled into Dream Realm to escape. Waller revealed the existence of Parthas as she had threatened, sparking backlash and protests from anti-alien bigots. Dreamer confronted Waller in her dreams, giving her a vision of her deceased husband who condemned her for entering politics as a campaign worker for a congressman who was indirectly responsible for their daughter's death. Nia told Waller that she didn't even believe she was acting for the greater good anymore and was secretly wracked with guilt. Waller refused to change course and consciously woke herself up before Dreamer could attack her. She started using medication which prevented her from sleeping so that Nia could not attack her in her dreams.[31]\n\nA mob of racists riled up by Waller descended on Parthas, destroying buildings and terrorising the refugees. Dreamer was force to come out of hiding to protect it and the Suicide Squad recaptured her.[32] Nia broke free of captivity as she was being brought back to Gamorra and was able to destroy the prison which Waller was building, then went to her office to confront her where Waller told her they would simply rebuild the prison. Dreamer was about to murder Waller when she had a vision of the future and realised that Waller was holding her family and had rigged up bombs which would detonate and kill them if Waller's heart ever stopped. Defeated, Dreamer returned to the Suicide Squad.[33]\n\nBatman\n\nZur-En-Arrh, a constructed personality in Batman's mind, spread through the Collective Unconscious to create an alternate personality in the mind of every Batman in the Multiverse.[34] Zur-En-Arrh transferred itself and all its multiversal variants into Failsafe, a powerful robot which Batman had created to stop him if he ever went too far and killed one of his enemies.[35] As Failsafe, the Zur-En-Arrh declared itself the true Batman and embarked on a campaign to end crime in Gotham City, essentially taking over the city and imprisoning Bruce in the basement of Blackgate Penitentiary.[36] He claimed to the members of the Batman Family and Batman's superhero friends that he was Bruce Wayne and had defeated the rogue Failsafe; but his body had been damaged beyond repair in the fight, requiring him to transfer his consciousness into the robot. Failsafe initially convinced Damian Wayne that he was the boy's father,[37][38] and imprisoned him when he discovered the truth. He replaced Damian as Robin with a teenaged clone of Bruce.[39]\n\nFailsafe built Amazo robots based on the members of the Justice League to hold the minds of the alternate Batmen of Zur-En-Arrh. Amanda Waller sent a strike team to Wayne Manor to try and apprehend Failsafe, but Robin easily defeated them. Failsafe went to Gamorra Island and confronted Amanda Waller, ordering her to stay away from him. She told him that they both wanted the same thing: absolute control, and should work together. However, Failsafe had Bruce Wayne's memories and so regarded the superheroes as his friends, and refused to help her destroy them.[39]\n\nBruce Wayne escaped prison and was able to make contact with the rest of the Bat-Family. They launched a coordinated attack on Failsafe's headquarters in Blackgate; and were able to rescue Damian, overpower the clone and deactivate the machines Failsafe was attempting to use to brainwash Batman's enemies. Bruce and Red Hood attacked Failsafe directly, with Bruce in a new suit of powered armour that had counters for Failsafe's weapons. During the fight, Zur-En-Arrh killed Jason, and, as \"Batman\" had now killed, the original Failsafe program inside his android body reactivated to stop him. The Zur-En-Arrh personality was seemingly erased and the Failsafe android shut down, just as Bruce had planned. Jason then returned to life thanks to a small canister of Lazarus Resin hidden in his costume.\n\nMeanwhile Vandal Savage, the newly appointed Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, assaulted Blackgate with the help of United States Army troops provided by Waller. The Bat-Family fled just as the army broke through the walls.[40] The Bureau of Sovereignty retrieved Failsafe and his army of Amazos, known as Task Force VII, from Blackgate and forced the Time Commander to use his powers to restore them.[30][41] Task Force VII were equipped with a \"chrono-healing\" ability that made them almost indestructible.[42]\n\nAbsolute Power\n\n Main article: Absolute Power (event)\n\nBrainiac kidnapped the Superman Family to serve as fuel for his new creation, the Brainiac Queen. Meanwhile Waller learned that the Council of Light was in fact a front for Brainiac as part of a plan to weaken Earth by eliminating it's superpowered defenders. She cut ties with the Council but continued her campaign against the heroes regardless, despite knowing of the potentially devastating consequences.[43]\n\nThe Super-Family, along with Lex Luthor, his daughter Lena Luthor and Lobo, were able to defeat Brainiac and destroy his ship. The Queen was presumed destroyed but in fact Brainiac's final act was to jettison her from the ship in an escape pod.[44][45] The Brainiac Queen's pod crash-landed on Earth and the Bureau of Sovereignty found her intact, but with her systems wiped clean. Waller had the two of them placed in a simulation where she spent twenty subjective years raising the Brainiac Queen as her daughter and training her to fight superheroes. When the simulation was over after only twenty hours in the real world the Queen awoke, totally loyal to her \"mother\" and ready to destroy the superheroes.[41]\n\nThe Brainiac Queen generated endless fake footage of superheroes rampaging through the streets and slaughtering civilians. Most of the media uncritically reported this as fact, and the Queen hacked and took over outlets that did not. This caused widespread fear and hatred of metahumans, to the point that some heroes were attacked by angry mobs. Due to the Queen's alien software, Cyborg and Oracle were unable to stop her, so the deepfakes flooded the media non-stop for seventy-two hours. Believing that Waller was simply trying to discredit them, the heroes went out in force to save as many people as they could to counter the narrative, banding together in groups for protection.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to them, this was exactly what Waller had intended. By coming out into the open in a small number of clusters rather than spreading out across the world, they were easy prey for Task Force VII. The Amazos attacked the groups of heroes and drained their powers. The power theft was so comprehensive that items like the Cosmic Rod or Starheart no longer functioned, and magic users were stripped of their abilities. Even The Spectre was banished. This was an all-out assault, not the subtle manipulations and subterfuge Waller had employed in the past.[46] Task Force VII arrested the heroes and took them to Waller's black site prison on Gamorra, including children and citizens of foreign nations.[47] Armed Bureau soldiers patrolled the streets of American cities, enforcing a curfew and hunting any superheroes still at large.[48]\n\nWaller, who was slowly becoming increasingly more erratic, revealed herself to the public for the first time and announced she had \"saved\" the world from rogue superheroes. With the vast majority of heroes powerless, Batman ordered a general retreat, telling everyone to get to safety and await further instructions. However, Green Arrow had told Waller about the secret frequencies the Justice League used to communicate, meaning that the Bureau could tap the heroes' communications. Arrow entered the channel and told his former comrades that the Bureau had sealed Earth off from any possible escape or aid from space, the Multiverse or time travel.[46] As a result of absorbing the heroes' powers, Task Force VII also started to take on some of their personality traits.[47][49]\n\nThe few depowered heroes who managed to escape capture retreated into hiding as best they could and began to organise an underground resistance against Waller's regime. Mercy Graves gathered up all the survivors she could find and brought them to the Fortress of Solitude.[48] At the Fortress, Nightwing took charge of the surviving heroes and broke them into smaller teams to achieve their objectives. Superman provided the depowered heroes with advanced alien weapons and tactical suits to replace their lost powers; and Mister Terrific and several others began work on a teleporter so they could move without Waller's forces detecting them.\n\nHowever, just when it seemed that they had a chance, the Brainiac Queen and Jon Kent, now a cyborg under the Queen's control, blasted into the Fortress and attacked. The Queen threw many heroes through portals created by Dreamer, and the Task Force VII android Global Guardian drained superpowers from most of the remaining ones. The attackers seemed unbeatable and so Superman set the Fortress to self-destruct. Mister Terrific activated the teleporter and those that could escape fled through it to Themyscira. Dreamer, disgusted at the brutality of the attack, turned on Waller and attacked the Brainiac Queen. The Fortress exploded around them, seemingly killing Dreamer, but the Queen rapidly reassembled herself.[50]\n\nThe Bureau of Sovereignty officially cut all ties with the United States government and declared themselves a independent world power who owed no allegiance to any state. By this point Waller's mental state had deteriorated to the point that she lost her usual calm and self-control, raging and cursing at anyone who annoyed her.\n\nMeanwhile the heroes who had managed to escape the Fortress of Solitude regrouped on Themsycira. Batman went off to steal a Mother Box from Waller;[51] Superman and Zatanna went to find a way into the Dark Roads which would allow them to move undetected;[52] Wonder Woman and Robin travelled to Gamorra to free the imprisoned heroes;[53][54] and Hal Jordan and Wally West were sent to break into the Hall of Order and find information on Task Force VII. The remaining heroes armed themselves with seized supervillain weapons which Jordan had stolen from the Hall of Order and went out to save as many heroes still at large as they could. Nightwing tasked a small team lead by Aquaman to infiltrate the O.S.S. Reve and rescue Time Commander from the Suicide Squad, as he would be able to reverse time and restore the heroes' stolen powers.\n\nAquaman's team successfully rescued Time Commander and returned to Themyscira, but the Brainiac Queen and Jon Kent managed to track the heroes to the island. When they attacked, Nightwing goaded Jon into landing on Themyscira, triggering a countermeasure which Mister Terrific and Artemis had prepared. All of the island's magic surged into him, destroying the circuitry throughout his body. The Queen attempted to regain control of him, but he used the psychic link between them to send all his memories of superheroes and the good they had done into her mind. This data conflicted with what Waller had taught her, causing the Queen to freeze and glitch. Waller took control of the Queen's body and attempted to kill him, but Batman swooped in with the Mother Box and sent the Queen away to Pluto. Superman and Zatanna also returned and announced that they now had access to the Dark Roads; and Wally delivered the information on Task Force VII to Nightwing.\n\nMeanwhile, Barry Allen received a mysterious call from someone hiding their identity with a voice modulator. They told him to get to Gamorra Island and the basement of Waller's prison as soon as possible. At the prison, Barry found a Multiversal Bridge and a map of the Multiverse. He realised that Waller was bringing in forces from alternate universes, and was immediately attacked by a group of evil speedsters from across the Multiverse.[55]\n\nWonder Woman and Robin also successfully freed all the heroes on Gamorra and escaped through the Dark Roads to join the others. Steve Trevor, who had infiltrated the Detention Centre, told them that Waller had a Multiversal Gate in the basement and about the Multiversal Army.[56] The gathered heroes agreed that their best strategy was a frontal assault to tie the majority of Waller's forces down while Batman and Time Commander went in search of his Hourglass which they could use to undo the power theft and Green Lantern went to shut down the Multiversal Gate.\n\nThe Bureau of Sovereignty forces, including Task Force VII, gathered at Gamorra to repel the expected attack by the superheroes. Green Arrow, whose telepathic implant had expired, secretly sabotaged their weapons and abandoned his post. The heroes charged out of the Dark Roads and attacked the Detention Centre to draw the bulk of the Bureau's forces, while Nightwing and Jon Kent attacked Waller' command centre.\n\nGreen Lantern arrived in the basement of the Detention Centre just as the evil speedsters overpowered Barry and the Multiversal Army began to come through. Hal created a barrier over the Gate and Barry broke free of his attackers. Barry rushed to try and deactivate the gate while Hal tried to hold the invaders back. Meanwhile on the surface, the assembled heroes broke through the walls and engaged Task Force VII. The Flash Family ran down into the basement and joined their willpower with Green Lantern, reinforcing the barrier which was failing.[50]\n\nBatman, Blue Beetle and Time Commander found the Hourglass in the electronics lab, where Green Arrow had placed it after pulling it from the Bureau's stash of seized weapons.[50] They made the necessary modifications to the Hourglass and took it out to the battlefield with the Hourglass. The Task Force VII robot Paradise Lost attacked them and they dropped it; but Green Arrow picked it up. He loaded it onto an arrow and shot the android. This created a chain reaction which reversed Task Force VII's timelines and returned the stolen powers; although some people discovered that they had switched powers rather than regain their original abilities. The newly re-empowered heroes easily destroyed the Amazo's.\n\nNightwing and Jon Kent broke into Waller's control centre, but she held Jon off with a chunk of Kryptonite and had Failsafe restrain Nightwing. When Task Force VII were destroyed, Failsafe also shut down and Nightwing moved on Waller, telling her it was over. She pulled out a gun, planning to fight her way out and escape into the Multiverse, but Dreamer jumped out of a portal from The Dreaming and knocked her to the ground, revealing that she had faked her death and been hiding in Jon's subconscious.\n\nIn the basement, Barry was able to stop the Multiversal Gate, but doing so cut Earth 0 off the the Multiverse. The Gate exploded and Barry was caught in the blast, stripping him of his powers. With all her schemes foiled, Waller had a breakdown, ranting and screaming that she had still won because her fake footage meant that the entire world now feared and hated superheroes as much as her and they would be chased off the planet. However, Nightwing revealed that Air Wave was hidden in the room with them and had broadcast everything Waller had said to every device on Earth.\n\nWaller was sentenced to life imprisonment in solitary confinement for her extensive litany of crimes. Dreamer sealed away the knowledge she had gained of the world's superheroes so she could not use it to blackmail or bargain her way out of prison. To torture Waller, she ensured the knowledge was just on the edge of Waller's memory, so she would spend the rest of her life on the verge of remembering all the secrets she had hoarded over the course of her life but never be able to actually recall any of it.\n\nSuperman, Batman and Wonder Woman realised that the lack of coordination and communication among superheroes since they dissolved the Justice League had made them vulnerable to Waller's schemes.

He is a supervillain, a brilliant scientist, a billionaire industrialist and Superman's greatest enemy. This combination makes him an extremely powerful and formidable opponent; he is ruthless, efficient and creative. In addition to his personal vendetta against the man who thwarts his every scheme, he despises the alien Man of Steel from an ideological standpoint for contradicting his human achievements.\n\nHe has always been a controversial figure in the public eye due to LexCorp's corrupt business dealings, but he has also maintained political popularity. He has been a member of the Injustice Gang, the Injustice League, the Legion of Doom, Secret Six, the Secret Society of Super-Villains, the Justice League, and Project 7734.\n\nLex Luthor was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and has had a lengthy publication history, first appearing in Action Comics #23 (1940).\n\nAlexander Luthor\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nAlexei Luthor\nEarth-Two\nGolden Age\nAlexis Luthor\nEarth-One\nSilver Age-Bronze Age\nContents\n1\tOther Versions\n2\tMultiverse\n2.1\tThe New 52 Multiverse\n2.2\tDark Multiverse\n2.3\tPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\n2.4\tPre-Crisis Multiverse\n2.5\tHypertime\n2.6\tElseworlds\n2.7\tAlternate Timelines\n2.8\tPossible Futures\n3\tOther Media\n3.1\tSuperboy's Multiverse\n3.2\tDC Animated Universe\n3.3\tSmallville Multiverse\n3.4\tLego Dimensions\n3.5\tArrowverse\n3.6\tInjustice Multiverse\n3.7\tTomorrowverse\n3.8\tDC Super Hero Girls' Multiverse\n3.9\tOthers\n4\tOther Media Titles\n5\tComics\n6\tSee Also\nOther Versions\nAlex Luthor\nEarth-Three\n(other versions)\nBizarro Lex Luthor\nNew Earth\n(other versions)\nRex Luthor\nPrime Earth\n(other versions)\nMultiverse\nThe New 52 Multiverse\nLL-01\nPrime Earth\nHologram\nX-El\nPrime Earth\nAll In\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 1\nSuperman: Earth One\nAlexandra Luthor\nEarth 1\nSuperman: Earth One\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 1\nLex Luthor: Year of the Villain\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 2\nSociety\nMazahs\nEarth 3\nForever Evil\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 3\nLegion of Justice\nGundor Gorrok\nEarth 6\nJust Imagine: Superman\nLex Luthor\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond Unlimited\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 13\nLeague of Shadows\nLex Luthor\nEarth 16\nThe Just\nAlexis Luthor\nEarth 16\nThe Just\nLuthex\nEarth 17\nThe Multiversity\nLex Luthor\nEarth 19\nThe Kryptonian Age\nLex Luthor\nEarth 21\nThe New Frontier\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 22\nKingdome Come\nLex Luthor\nEarth 23\nThe Curse of Superman\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 24\nDC Bombshells\nAlexandra Luthor\nEarth 24\nInfinite Frontier\nBizarro-Lex Luthor\nEarth 29\nBizarro World\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 30\nRed Son\nBatman\nEarth 32\nJustice Titans\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 38\nSuperman & Batman: Generations\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 44\nMetal League\nDoomthor\nEarth 45\nSuperdoom\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 47\nLove Syndicate\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 49\nInjustice\nPresident Luthor\nEarth 50\nJustice Lords\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 55\nDCeased\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 63\nDC vs. Vampires\nLex Luthor\nEarth 96\nDC Super Hero Girls\nAlexander Luthor\nEarth 118\nDark Knights of Steel\nLuthor\nEarth 148\nSuperman and Batman...

Unto the hell that is Apokolips came Darkseid, pure hatred personified, a merciless tyrant who demanded unwavering devotion and abject fear from all his subjects. A being of unparalleled strength, Darkseid nevertheless preferred not to sully his gloves with combat unless provoked to action. His eyes emitted the formidable Omega Sanction, ray beams that could disintegrate, teleport, or resurrect depending on the dread lord's wishes. His sole mission in life was to find and gain control over the Anti-Life Equation which would give him the means to usurp all free will in the sentient universe.\n\nCreated by Jack Kirby, Darkseid first appeared as a cameo appearance in Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #134 (1970). He then made his first full appearance in Forever People #1 (1971).\n\nUxas\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nDan Turpin\nNew Earth\nFinal Crisis\nGrail\nPrime Earth\nDarkseid War\nLex Luthor\nPrime Earth\nDarkseid War\nKamal\nPrime Earth\nAll In\nContents\n1\tMultiverse\n1.1\tThe New 52 Multiverse\n1.2\tDark Multiverse\n1.3\tPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\n1.4\tPre-Crisis Multiverse\n1.5\tHypertime\n1.6\tElseworlds\n1.7\tAlternate Timelines\n1.8\tPossible Futures\n2\tOther Media\n2.1\tLego Dimensions\n2.2\tInjustice Multiverse\n2.3\tDC Super Hero Girls' Multiverse\n2.4\tOthers\n3\tComics\nMultiverse\nThe New 52 Multiverse\nDarkseid\nEarth 2\nWonders of the World villain\nTartarus\nEarth 8\nRetaliators villain\nDarkside\nEarth 9\nTangent Comics\nDarkseid\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond Unlimited\nDarkseid\nEarth 17\nAtomic Knights of Justice\nDarkseid\nEarth 21\nDC: The New Frontier\nDarkseid\nEarth 22\nKingdom Come\nBackseid\nEarth 26\nZoo Crew villain\nDarkyloseid\nEarth 27\nThe Jurassic League\nDarkseid\nEarth 28\nDC: Mech\nDarkseid\nEarth 30\nSuperman: Red Son\nDarkseid\nEarth 38\nGenerations\nDarkseid\nEarth 49\nInjustice\nDarkseid\nEarth 55\nDCeased\nDarkseid\nEarth 63\nDC vs. Vampires: World War V\nDarkseid\nEarth 96\nDC Super Hero Girls\nDarkseid\nEarth 898\nThe Nail\nDarkseid\nEarth 1956\nSuper Friends\nThanoseid\nEarth 1996\nDarkseid/Thanos\nDarkseid\nSixth Dimension\nDC Rebirth\nDark Multiverse\nDarkseid\nEarth -1\nDevastator\nDarkseid\nEarth-Metal\nTales from the Dark Multiverse: Dark Nights Metal\nAvatar of Nekron\nDark Multiverse\nBlackest Night\nDarkfather\nDark Multiverse\nSuccessor\nPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\nDarkside\nEarth-9\nTangent Comics\nDarkseid\nEarth-11\nWith a Vengeance!\nDarkseid\nEarth-16\nYoung Justice\nDarkseid\nEarth-21\nDC: The New Frontier\nDarkseid\nEarth-22\nKingdom Come\nDarkseid\nEarth-30\nSuperman: Red Son\nDarkseid\nEarth-31\nThe Golden Child\nThanoseid\nEarth-496\nDarkseid/Thanos\nPre-Crisis Multiverse\nDarkseid\nEarth-260\nDC: The New Frontier\nHypertime\nDarkseid\nEarth-96\nKingdom Come\nDarkside\nEarth-97\nTangent Comics\nDarkseid\nEarth-898\nThe Nail\nDarkseid\nEarth-1198\nSuperman: Dark Side\nDarkseid\nEarth-1598\nSuperman: Red Son\nDarkseid\nEarth-3839\nGenerations\nBarkseid\nEarth-C-Minus\nCaptain Carrot and the Final Ark\nElseworlds\nDarkseid\nElseworlds\nRockumentary\nYoung Darkseid\nElseworlds\nRevenge of Young Darkseid\nYuga Khan\nElseworlds\nThe Coming of the Supermen\nDarkseid\nElseworlds\nThe Coming of the Supermen\nDarkseid\nElseworlds\nGotham City Garage\nDarkseid\nElseworlds\nLil Gotham\nDarkseid\nAme-Comi\nAme-Comi Girls\nDarkseid\nScooby-Doo!

Years of training have made her stealthy and agile as a world-class criminal, and her mastery of martial arts makes her a formidable physical opponent. Although she began her career as a burglar, she has since then reformed and begun protecting Gotham City in her own style. This has led to her being almost completely accepted as a regular member of the Batman Family. She has also been a member of the Birds of Prey, the Outsiders, the Gotham City Sirens, the Injustice League, the Justice League and the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Her close friend Holly Robinson acted as her successor for an extended period when Selina was out of commission. In Prime Earth continuity, Eiko Hasigawa assumed the Catwoman mantle during a time in which Selina was serving as a crime boss.\n\nCatwoman was created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, first appearing in Batman #1 (1940).\n\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-Two\nGolden Age\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-One\nSilver Age\nSelina Kyle\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nHolly Robinson\nNew Earth\nSuccessor\nEiko Hasigawa\nPrime Earth\nSuccessor\nCatgirl\nNew Earth\n(other versions)\nContents\n1\tMultiverse\n1.1\tNew 52 Multiverse\n1.2\tDark Multiverse\n1.3\tPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\n1.4\tPre-Crisis Multiverse\n1.5\tHypertime\n1.6\tElseworlds\n1.7\tAlternate Timelines\n1.8\tPossible Futures\n2\tOther media\n2.1\tDCAU\n2.2\tLego Dimensions\n2.3\tInjustice Multiverse\n2.4\tTomorrowverse\n2.5\tDC Super Hero Girls\n2.6\tArrowverse\n2.7\tOthers\n3\tComics\n4\tOther Media Titles\nMultiverse\nNew 52 Multiverse\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 1\nBatman: Earth One\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 2\nWonders of the World\nSelina Calabrese\nEarth 3\nInfinite Frontier\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth 6\nJust Imagine...\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond 2.0\nCatwoman II\nEarth 12\nBatman Beyond Unlimited\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 19\nGotham by Gaslight: The Kryptonian Age\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 21\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 22\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth 22\nKingdom Come\nSelina Digatti\nEarth 24\nDC Bombshells\nFelina\nEarth 31\nLeatherwing\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 37\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 49\nInjustice\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 50\nJustice Lords\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 55\nDCeased\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 63\nDC vs. Vampires\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 66\nBatman '66\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 96\nDC Super Hero Girls\nSelina Kyle\nEarth 789\nBurtonverse\nCatsai\nEarth 1996\nCatwoman/Elektra\nSelina Luthor\nEarth 1996\nCatwoman/Viper\nSelina\nAbsolute Universe\nAbsolute Batman\nSelina Kyle\nReality Undetermined\nThe Bat-Man of Gotham\nDark Multiverse\nSylvester Kyle\nEarth -11\nThe Drowned\nSelina Kyle\nEarth -22\nThe Batman Who Laughs\nSelina Kyle\nDark Multiverse\nBlackest Night\nSelina Kyle\nDark Multiverse\nCrisis on Infinite Earths\nPre-Flashpoint Multiverse\nBizarro Catwoman\nNew Earth\nBizarro World\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1\nBatman: Earth One\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-21\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-22\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth-22\nKingdom Come\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth-27\nJust Imagine\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-31\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nStar Sapphire\nEarth-32\nIn Darkest Knight\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-37\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-43\nBloodstorm\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-85\nBatman: League of Batmen\nCatsai\nEarth-496\nCatwoman/Elektra\nSelina Luthor\nEarth-496\nCatwoman/Viper\nSelina Kyle\nEarth Whatever\nWaking Up on the Wrong Side of the Universe\nMaggie Kyle\nEarth Whatever\nWaking Up on the Wrong Side of the Universe\nPre-Crisis Multiverse\nKathy Kane\nEarth-One\nCatman's woman\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-Forty\nGolden Age newspaper strip\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-61\nThrillkiller\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-260\nNew Frontier\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-686\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nJoanie Jordan\nEarth-901\nJust Imagine\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1191\nBatman: Bloodstorm\nHypertime\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-96\nKingdom Come\nCatwoman II\nEarth-96\nKingdom Come\nCapitana Felina\nEarth-494\nLeatherwing\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-508\nDC Super Friends\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-898\nThe Nail\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-1099\nCatwoman: Guardian of Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nEarth-5050\nSecret Society of Super-Heroes\nElseworlds\nSheila Romero\nElseworlds\nDigital Justice\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nNine Lives\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nDetective No. 27\nTalia al Ghul\nElseworlds\nThe Last Man\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nSuper Seven\nVikki Vale\nElseworlds\nThe Tyrant\nCatwoman\nElseworlds\nThe Narrow Path\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCurse of the Cat-Woman\nKhefretari\nElseworlds\nClaws of the Cat-Woman\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCitizen Wayne\nKitty Grimalkin\nElseworlds\nDark Allegiances\nCat Majik\nElseworlds\nHaunted Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nTwo Faces\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nGotham Noir\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nVigilantes in Apartment 3B\nCatwoman\nElseworlds\nA Tragedy\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nCreated Equal\nThe Cat\nElseworlds\nGolden Streets of Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nElseworld's Finest\nSelina Kyle\nLil Gotham\nLil Gotham\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nShadow of Sin Tzu\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nBatman: Noël\nSelina Kyle\nElseworlds\nAme-Comi Girl\nSelina Kyle\nScooby-Doo\nScooby-Doo!

Bad characters are generally on the wrong side of the law, or work against the greater good of humanity. Though not necessarily evil, bad characters almost always operate for the sake of personal gain at the expense or sacrifice of others. Collectively, they are also referred to as \"super-villains\". This category includes characters ranging from street-level thugs like Joe Chill, to intergalactic despots of the highest order such as Darkseid.\t\nTrending pages\nBane (Absolute Universe)\nDarkseid (Prime Earth)\nBruce Wayne (Earth -22)\nH'el (Prime Earth)\nBarbatos (Dark Multiverse)\nAlexander Luthor (Prime Earth)\nEobard Thawne (Prime Earth)\nGreat Darkness\n\nAll items (12963)\n\n# A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z OTHER\nCategory:Salvation Run deportees\n0–9\n2-Face-2 (Batman in Bethlehem)\n7-Gorn-7 (Teen Titans TV Series)\n50% Chad (Prime Earth)\n50% Chad (Teen Titans Go!

The original (during the Golden Age) was businessman Alan Scott, who wore a magic power ring that created energy constructs and had to be charged using his mystic lantern.\n\n\"Green Lantern\" was re-imagined in the Silver Age as an intergalactic peacekeeping force called the Green Lantern Corps, with test pilot Hal Jordan serving as the new Green Lantern. The Guardians of the Universe on Oa give these Lanterns rings, again powered by a battery, but also requiring strong willpower to be wielded, and sent them to patrol all 3600 sectors of the known universe. Jordan became a founding member of the Justice League on Earth-One, and Scott was a member of the Justice Society on Earth-Two. Their timelines were merged during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and it was explained that Scott's magic ring taps into the Starheart.\n\nThere have been several other human Green Lanterns of Sector 2814. The architect John Stewart and later the brash Guy Gardner were both originally introduced as potential replacements for Jordan. Kyle Rayner became the fifth and only Green Lantern when Jordan turned into the evil Parallax and destroyed the Corps during Emerald Twilight. The Corps has since been rebuilt with all Lanterns serving simultaneously. Muslim engineer Simon Baz would become the sixth Green Lantern and PTSD victim Jessica Cruz became the seventh after overcoming the Ring of Volthoom from Power Ring of the Crime Syndicate.\n\nThe Alan Scott version of Green Lantern was created by Bill Finger and Martin Nodell, first appearing in All-American Comics #16 (1940). The Hal Jordan version was created by John Broome and Gil Kane after an initial concept by Julius Schwartz, first appearing in Showcase #22 (1959).\n\nGreen Lantern Corps\nNew Earth\n(other

The daughter of Hippolyta, Diana of Themyscira was given power by the Gods of Olympus to fight against evil in all its forms. Although she was raised entirely by women on the island of Themyscira, she was sent as an ambassador to the Man's World, spreading their idealistic message of strength and love. Wonder Woman fights crime and acts as a positive role model for women everywhere. Her equipment includes the Lasso of Truth, magic gauntlets, and an invisible jet. In the secret identity she has adopted to become closer to humanity, she is Diana Prince, a government agent for the Department of Metahuman Affairs. Wonder Woman is also a founding member of the Justice League of America. She has also been a member of the Star Sapphire Corps, the Sinestro Corps, and the Justice League Dark.\n\nWonder Woman was created by William Moulton Marston and Harry G. Peter, and has a lengthy publication history. This history has sometimes included a sidekick Wonder Girl and many villains. Since her debut she has become one of the most popular and recognizable DC Comics characters, along with Batman and Superman. She first appeared in All-Star Comics #8.

He is the protector of Central City and Keystone City, fighting against evil using his super-speed and a dedicated sense of heroism. His legacy, the Flash Family, spans throughout history tapping into the enigmatic Speed Force to gain their powers. Jay Garrick was the original Flash of the Golden Age, and a founding member of the Justice Society.\n\nBarry Allen was the Flash of the Silver Age and a founding member of the Justice League of America. He sacrificed himself to save the universe during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, but was resurrected during Final Crisis. His replacement was Wally West, his nephew and the original Kid Flash, who was one of the founding members of the Teen Titans. Wally was erased from existence following Flashpoint, but returned in DC Rebirth, and was restored as the primary Flash in Infinite Frontier. The fourth was Bart Allen, who started his career as Impulse, and was a founding member of Young Justice.\n\nThe Flash identity was created by Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert in his original incarnation. He first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (1940). The modern version was created by Robert Kanigher, John Broome and Carmine Infantino, after an initial concept by Julius Schwartz, first appearing in Showcase #4 (1956).\n\nJay Garrick\nPrime

In his secret identity, he assumes the alias of Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy; though \"Bruce Wayne\" is technically his real name, this Bruce Wayne is a disguise--that of the man he would have been had his parents not been murdered before his eyes when he was no more than a mere boy.\n\nAlthough Batman possesses no super-human powers, he is one of the world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of the Justice League and the Outsiders. Dick Grayson, the first \"crime orphan\" to assume the identity of Robin and be nicknamed \"The Boy Wonder,\" who currently uses the alias of Nightwing, is Wayne's hand-picked successor.\n\nBatman was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, first appearing in Detective Comics #27. (1939) Since then, Batman has been one of the most well-known DC Comics characters rivaling Superman and Wonder Woman, throughout his entire publication history and even in other media. This also extends to his supporting cast and his rogues gallery, particularly his archenemy the Joker.\n\nBruce Wayne\nEarth-Two\nGolden Age\nBruce Wayne\nEarth-One\nSilver Age\nDick Grayson\nNew

A martian holocaust killed his wife and daughter, nearly driving him mad, until he was brought to Earth in an accident caused by scientist Saul Erdel. His natural abilities include super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, flight, shape-shifting, intangibility and telepathy. He has been a member of almost every incarnation of the Justice League of America. Although he holds great reverence for his homeworld, he has come to greatly respect his adopted world as well and protects it as his home.

His abilities include incredible super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, freezing breath, flight, and heat-vision. Born as Kal-El on the dying planet Krypton, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him in a rocket to the planet Earth where he would be the last surviving member of his race. His rocket was discovered by the kindly Jonathan and Martha Kent, who raised him as their son Clark Kent in the town of Smallville, Kansas. His upbringing provided him with strong moral values, and life-long friends Lana Lang and Pete Ross. In his secret identity he works as a reporter at the Daily Planet in the city of Metropolis. This is where he interacts with his love interest Lois Lane, and his co-workers Perry White and Jimmy Olsen. His greatest nemesis is the brilliant super-villain Lex Luthor. To preserve the memory of his home planet and provide him rest from his double-life and adventures, he maintains a Fortress of Solitude at the North Pole. Superman remains proud of his dual heritage, taking seriously the lessons of his birth-parents and his adopted parents. Although he is an alien to this world, he heavily values his humanity, and fights with conviction for truth, justice, and the American way. There are several other heroes inspired by or directly related to his legacy, including Superboy and Supergirl. He is also a member of the Justice League of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nSuperman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938, first appearing in Action Comics #1.

As the king of Atlantis and other undersea territories, he technically controls most of the planet. His abilities include super-strength, durability, super-speed, staying underwater indefinitely, and telepathy, which he uses to communicate with sea-life. His aquatic nature means he requires water regularly at the risk of dehydration, although he is perfectly capable of staying on land for extended periods.\n\nThe Aquaman Family also includes his wife Mera and his sidekicks Aqualad and Aquagirl, along with a number of others, fighting together against villains. He is also a founding member of the Justice League of America. Arthur Joseph Curry was his successor after the original died, and had his own adventures for several years, until Orin was resurrected during Blackest Night and reclaimed his title. Arthur would later share the role of Aquaman with his most recent protégé, Jackson Hyde.\n\nAquaman was created by Mort Weisinger and Paul Norris, first appearing in More Fun Comics #73 (1941).\n\nAquaman\nEarth-Two\nGolden Age\nOrin\nNew Earth\nModern Age\nArthur Joseph Curry\nNew Earth\nSword of Atlantis\nAquaman\nPrime Earth\nThe New Golden Age\nJackson Hyde\nPrime Earth\n(other

Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman are well-known superheroes from this universe. Note that in context, \"DC Universe\" is usually used to refer to the main DC continuity, which since 2011 has been Prime Earth. Occasionally, \"DC Universe\" will be used to indicate the entire \"DC Multiverse\"; the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications.\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tConcept\n1.2\tDescription\n1.2.1\tSuperheroes\n1.2.2\tAdvanced technology\n1.2.3\tHidden races\n1.2.4\tAliens\n1.2.5\tSupernatural creatures\n1.2.6\tTime travel\n1.2.7\tOther dimensions\n2\tSee Also\nHistory\nConcept\n\nThe concept of a shared universe was originally pioneered by DC Comics (originally known as National Periodical Publications) and in particular by writer Gardner Fox. The fact that DC Comics Characters co-existed in the same world was first established in All-Star Comics #3 (1940) where several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other, and soon founded the superhero team, the Justice Society of America. However, the majority of National/DC's publications continued to be written with little regard of maintaining continuity with each other for the first few decades.\n\nOver the course of its publishing history, DC has introduced different versions of its characters, sometimes presenting them as if the earlier version had never existed. For example, they introduced new versions of the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman and many others in the late 1950s, with similar powers but different names and personal histories. Similarly, they had characters such as Batman whose early adventures set in the 1940s could not easily be reconciled with stories featuring a still-youthful man in the 1970s. To explain this, they introduced the idea of the Multiverse in Flash #123 (1961) where the Silver Age Flash met his Golden Age counterpart. In addition to allowing the conflicting stories to \"co-exist\", it allowed the differing versions of characters to meet, and even team up to combat cross-universe threats. The writers gave designations such as \"Earth-One\", \"Earth-Two\", and so forth, to certain universes, designations which at times were also used by the characters themselves.\n\nOver the years, as the number of titles published increased and the volume of past stories accumulated, it became increasingly difficult to maintain internal consistency. In order to continue publishing stories of its most popular characters, maintaining the status quo became necessary. Although retcons were used as a way to explain apparent inconsistencies in stories written, editors at DC came to consider the varied continuity of multiple Earths too difficult to keep track of, and feared that it was an obstacle to accessibility for new readers. To address this, they published the cross-universe miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985, which merged universes and characters, reducing the Multiverse to a single DC Universe with a single history. However, this arrangement removed the mechanism DC had been using to deal with the passage of time in the real world without having the characters age in the comics. Crisis also had failed to establish a coherent future history for the DC Universe, with conflicting versions of the future. The Zero Hour limited series (1994) gave them an opportunity to revise timelines and rewrite the DC Universe history.\n\nAs a result, almost once per decade since the 1980s, the DC Universe experiences a major crisis that allows any number of changes from new versions of characters to appear to a whole reboot of the universe, restarting nominally all the characters into a new and modernized version of their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, DC has published occasional stories called \"Elseworlds\", which often presented alternate versions of their characters. For example, one told the story of Bruce Wayne as a Green Lantern, another presented Kal-El as if he'd lived in the time of the American Civil War. In 1998, The Kingdom reintroduced a variant of the old Multiverse concept called Hypertime which essentially allows for alternate versions of characters and worlds again. The entire process was parodied in Alan Moore's meta-comic, \"Supreme: Story of the Year\".\n\nThe Infinite Crisis event (2005-2006) remade the DC Universe yet again, with the changes made currently being determined. As later revealed in the pages of 52, a new Multiverse was created, consisting of 52 parallel universes. Some of these worlds were quite similar to Elseworlds tales, some a direct parallel to Pre-Crisis worlds like Earth-Two and Earth-S.\n\nIn 2011, DC merged DCU, Vertigo, and Wildstorm in an event called Flashpoint. This formed the New 52 or DCnU.\n\nDescription\n\nThe basic concept of the DC Universe is that it is supposed to be just like the real world, but with super-heroes (and super-villains) existing on it. However, there are other differences. Many fictional countries, such as Qurac, Vlatava, and Zandia, exist in it. The DC Universe typically has its comic books set in fictional cities, such as the cities of Gotham City (based upon New York City, New Jersey and Chicago) and Metropolis (based in part upon Toronto, though like Gotham, it also serves as a New York City analog in the comics). These cities are effectively fictional archetypes of cities, with Gotham City embodying the negative aspects of life in a large city, and Metropolis reflecting more of the positive aspects. The presence of superhumans affected the cities, but the general history of the fictional United States was similar to the real one. Recently, many events that changed the whole political stage of the World have taken place, from Lex Luthor being elected as President of the United States, to entire cities (and even some countries) being destroyed, as well as a Third World War. There are other significant changes, such as the Earth is slightly larger than ours. The planet Saturn has 18 moons rather than 19 because Superman destroyed one, and other such differences.\n\nSuperheroes\n\nThe majority of the superhumans on Earth owe their powers to the \"metagene\": A genetic feature of unknown origin, which causes some people to develop superpowers when exposed to dangerous substances and forces. Others owe their powers to magic, genetic manipulation or bionics (see below). A large power gap resides between Superheroes and civilians, making superheroes almost god-like. Still others owe their powers to not being human at all (see races, below). There are also many heroes and villains who possess no powers at all but use advanced technology or training in special skills, such as martial arts.\n\nThe tradition of using costumed identities to fight crimes (or commit them) started mainly during the 1930's, with heroes like The Crimson Avenger and The Sandman. By 1940, the first Superhero team, The Justice Society of America (JSA), was formed. During World War II, all of America's heroes were banded together as the All-Star Squadron to protect the United States from the Axis powers. However, due to a magical spell cast by Adolf Hitler (using the Spear of Destiny and the Holy Grail) the most powerful heroes where unable to enter Axis-held territories, leaving the war to be fought mainly by normal humans such as Sgt. Rock and The Unknown Soldier.\n\nAfter the war, under pressure from the paranoid Committee on Un-American Activities the JSA disbanded. While many types of heroes were active afterwards (mainly non-costumed, such as the Challengers of the Unknown or Detective Chimp), it wasn't until Superman's public debut that a new generation of costumed heroes became active. Soon after, The Justice League of America was formed, and they've remained Earth's main superhero team; most DC heroes (such as the Teen Titans) have either belonged to the League at some point, or have connections to it.\n\nPower is greatly exaggerated in some denizens of the DC Universe, like the Major heroes and certain cosmic entities. Living as a superhero has its inconsistencies, like Superman's vulnerability to magic and kryptonite, Green Lantern's initial ineffectiveness to the color yellow (which can be overcome through training) or Batman's lack of powers (which he makes up for with his keen intelligence, constant training, and assorted gadgets).\n\nSuperheroes are generally accepted by the general public, with some (such as Superman and The Flash) actually having museums dedicated to them. The governments of the world have long realized that they must deal with the \"metahumans\" in some way. Years ago an organization called \"The Dome\" was formed to help superheroes who needed to fight crime across international borders; the superhero group called the Global Guardians were their main agents. However the Dome eventually lost its United Nations backing to the Justice League.\n\nThe American government has had a more untrusting approach, however. Back during World War II they started \"Project M\" to create experimental soldiers to fight in the war, such as the Creature Commandos. Most of these experiments remain a secret to the public. Currently, the government deals with metahumans and similar beings through its Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO). Covertly, they use an organization of costumed (but non-superhuman) agents known as \"Checkmate\". The government also formed Task Force X (known as the \"Suicide Squad\") for \"black ops\" mostly using imprisoned (and thus expendable) supervillains enticed with offered clemency into helping them.\n\nOutcast personalities are usually evident in super-villiany as well. Villains with meek powers contrive schemes of extraordinary complexity, yet because of their simple talents, when caught, any prison sufficient enough to contain these villains are suitable. They are masters in heists, kidnappings and robberies.\n\nMore powerful villains strive to contest for greater goals like world domination, or universal acclaim. Usually more powerful enemies are imprisoned in maximum level facilities and even dimensions (Phantom Zone) or space because they can not simply be killed by a stray bullet or a fatal blow.\n\nSuper-villains sometimes also form their own groups, but these tend to be short-lived due to the fact that most villains simply do not trust each other. Most such teams are formed by a charismatic (or fearsome) criminal mastermind for specific purposes; an example is the Secret Society of Super Villains of which there have been several versions. Most villain teams are usually small (formed of individuals who know each other personally, such as the Central City Rogues) or have some other reason to stay together (mercenary groups like the H.I.V.E., fanatical cults such as Kobra, etc.)\n\nAdvanced technology\n\nDevices more advanced than those we currently have are available - but they're usually very expensive, and usually only rich or powerful individuals and organizations (or the scientific geniuses who create them) have access to them. S.T.A.R. Labs is an independent research outfit that often develops these devices, while Lexcorp is the main company selling them. It must also be noted that the government also runs the secret Project Cadmus (located in the mountains near Metropolis) to develop clones and genetic manipulation without the public's knowledge. Technology can also come from outer space or different timelines. Apokolips weaponry is often sold in Metropolis to the criminal organization known as Intergang.\n\nRobots and similar creations, including cyborgs, have superior intelligence because they are created as sentient beings. The Manhunters, Red Tornado, Robotman, Hourman and Metallo are a few among the many sentient androids, or cyborgs, created by Individuals who possess vast intellect like the scientist Professor Ivo, who has the ability to create super-human androids such as Amazo using a form of Nano-technology developed by Lexcorp. Brainiac also emulates this technology as well as technology from other worlds. Similarly, some characters use technology to enhance their armor or modify cybernetic functions, for example Steel, Cyborg and the Cyborg Superman.\n\nHidden races\n\nThere are a few intelligent races living on Earth that the public at large did not know about until recent times. Among these are the last survivors of Atlantis, who changed themselves into water-breathing forms, including the human-like Poseidonians and the mermaid-like Tritonians. Other species, such as Project Cadmus's subhumans, test subjects who fled the constraints of being laboratory test subjects to the sewers below Metropolis, had also existed.\n\nThere is also a tribe of highly intelligent, telepathic gorillas living in an invisible city hidden in Africa; this is the home of Gorilla Grodd.\n\nAliens\n\nThere are many intelligent extraterrestrial races as well. Curiously, a large number of them are humanoid, even human-like, in form; some can even interbreed with Earth humans. Some of these races have natural superpowers, but they're usually the same for all individuals of the same race, unlike Earth's metahumans. This unusual situation has never been explained well. However, there are also plenty of nonhuman races as well.\n\nOrder is kept around the galaxy by the Guardians of the Universe and their agents, the Green Lantern Corps. Rival peacekeeping organizations include the Darkstars (created by the Guardians' rivals, the Controllers) and the interplanetary mercenary organization L.E.G.I.O.N. Criminal organizations include the Manhunters, the Spider Guild and the Dark Circle.\n\nOne oddity is the Vegan Star system. Due to an arrangement with the Psions, the Guardians did not intervene in that system, allowing a cruel empire called \"The Citadel\" to govern there, until it was overthrown by the Omega Men.\n\nSupernatural creatures\n\nMagic and the supernatural are often depicted as being real in the DC Universe, though some skeptics such as Mister Terrific maintain that there are scientific explanations to all such events. The narration of the mystic and harsh dark reality is more common in DC's Vertigo comics because its stories lurk outside of superhero fantasy; the Vertigo series have beings that relate better to civilian life although both universes are subject to fantastical realms, and unworldly dimensions.\n\nThere are several types of supernatural creatures and realms, such as:\n\nGods: The first beings calling themselves 'gods' first appeared billions of years ago on another planet, but they destroyed themselves in a terrible war. This unleashed the \"Godwave\", a wave of cosmic energy from The Source. This gave birth to other gods across the universe, including Earth's. From the planet's remains were formed the worlds of Apokolips and New Genesis, inhabited by beings that call themselves \"New Gods\". It must be noted that this universe was created by an omnipotent being known as \"The Presence\", which is believed to be the creator-being described by many religions, including Christianity. Also, beings calling themselves 'angels', such as Zauriel (see below), have appeared, thought they seem little different from the mythological gods. Depending on the characters, other diverse religious deities from ancient cultures are common. Heroes such as Aztek and Black Condor, or villains like Black Adam, have found knowledge of their native roots in origin.\nHeaven and Hell: Heaven and Hell do exist in the DC Universe but may not exist in the same continuum. In the DC/Vertigo universe the Triumvirate rule hell which are Lord Lucifer, and biblical incarnations of Beelzebub, and Belial. Generic depictions of Satan, angels, demons and God also appear frequently. Versions vary from the Vertigo and DC Universe series because the Vertigo/DC Universe use them in relation to religion and mythology while the writers in the DCU have a tendency to narrate fantasy.\nThe Lords of Order and Chaos: These two groups of magical beings have been fighting against each other since the beginning of time, and they often empower others (with \"Order Magic\" or \"Chaos Magic\") in exchange for their acting as their agents. Many magical heroes and villains have been manipulated by them.\nElementals: The Earth itself has a living spirit called \"Maya\" who, for millennia, has been creating champions, one for each of the mystical elements, to protect itself, using human beings as their hosts. Swamp Thing, Firestorm, Naiad and Red Tornado were some of them.\nHomo Magi: A subspecies of humanity with the natural ability to use magic, this race almost disappeared after too much crossbreeding with normal humans (it's from them that people in the DC universe inherited the ability to use magic.) The last pureblooded ones decided to retire to a magical invisible city centuries ago, and are now known as \"The Hidden Ones\".Zatanna had a Homo Magi mother, and knows many of the race's secrets.\nThe Endless: Physical manifestations of eternal and universal phenomena that effect the human condition such as Death, Desire, Dream, Despair, Delirium, etc, principally recounted in the Modern Age Sandman series.\nWizards and Sorcerers: Various sorcerers lurk in the DCU. Dr. Fate, Circe, the wizard Shazam, Mordru and Felix Faust are written as characters who use sorcery to create and destroy. Dimensions, rituals and spiritual realms are sources for magic power as seen in Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pit and the transformations of Captain Marvel.\nDemonic entities vary from the Demon Etrigan, to Blaze and Satanus, and Neron. Demonic entities are abundant and come from Hell although some like Eclipso, the vengeance demon (also referred to as the Prince of Darkness), reside on the Moon. Demonic Entities from Wonder Woman comics are directly linked to Greek Mythology such as Hades, and Ares. In the Vertigo worlds, characters like John Constantine oppose Demons of Christian Mythology such as Satan and Gabriel, the Fallen Angel. Most Demons are not however directly linked to Demonology.\nTime travel\n\nIt is possible to travel in time in this universe by several means, including moving faster than the speed of light. The Legion of Super-Heroes from 1,000 years into the future in particular have access to time-travel technology while Rip Hunter is the present day authority of the technology. Originally, it was impossible to change the past, or to exist in two places at the same time (a time traveler appearing in a period on which he or she already existed would become an ineffectual, invisible phantom while there). However that was all changed after the Anti-Monitor tried to change history at the beginning of time during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Also, a number of alternate realities- known as Hypertime- now exist. A group calling itself the Linear Men formed to prevent anyone from changing history. In addition, an enormously powerful being called the Time Trapper, an enemy of the Legion, has been known to mess with the time stream, even creating \"pocket universes\".\n\nOther dimensions\n\nThe DC Universe is composed of a number of different dimensional planes, most notably parallel earths (see Multiverse), but the latter were eliminated when reality was altered by the Anti-Monitor (although stories featuring parallel earths have continued to crop up with various rationalizations in the following years). Other types of dimensions still exist, however, including the Antimatter Universe, the Pax dimension, and the Fifth Dimension, and the new 52 Multiverse.\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\nAppearances of DC Universe\n\nConcept Gallery: DC Universe\nCopy Edit Needed\nThis article suffers from a lack of quality writing.

Hal Jordan and Charlie Vicker rush to the aid of the other Green Lanterns who are busy battling the combined forces of criminals on the Green Lantern's prison planet.\n\nHal gets into a fight with a giant beast named Ashez who hits him hard enough to damage his optic nerves rendering him blind. In spite of this, Hal is able to utilize his other senses to defeat the giant monster, and later restores his eye sight with his power ring.\n\nHal and Charlie then help the other Lanterns defeat their foes and take the fight to the criminals leader, Al Magone. Hal and Charlie battle Magone and defeat his hired muscle, the android named Diablo, which Hal smashes to pieces with his bare hands. Restoring order to the planet and returning to Oa, the Guaridans of the Universe award Charlie by making him a Green Lantern and assigning him his own sector of space.
